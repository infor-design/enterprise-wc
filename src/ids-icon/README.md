# Ids Icon Component

## Description

The design system provides a list of standard icons which can be used in your applications. This listing is a result of a studying common Infor iconography and consolidating that with standardized icons (for example, a floppy disk to represent a "save" function). The icons in the list should be familiar to users.

## Use Cases

- Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.
- Use too many icons and they'll become nothing more than decoration. Their use for navigation on a webpage can often cause dilution.

## Terminology

- **Icon**: An icon is a symbol. In this design case this is literal, for example  the little trashcan to indicate delete.
- **Svg**: Stands for eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector graphic format for the Web and other environments

## Features (With Code Examples)

For a normal sized icon just specific the icon name and the web component will display the appropriate icon.

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes"></ids-icon>
```

Icons come in 3 sizes depending where it is used.

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="large"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="medium"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="small"></ids-icon>
```

## States and Variations

- Color
- Size
- Alert

## Keyboard Guidelines

An icon is not on its own keyboard focusable and has no keyboard interaction.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Flows within its parent/placement and is usually centered vertically.

## Converting from Previous Versions

- 3.x: Icons have all new markup and classes.
- 4.x: Icons have all new markup and classes again.
- 4.x: Icons have all new markup and classes and a custom element for web components.

## Alternate Designs

Icons differ in the two provided theme/icon versions.

## Proposed Changes

- Fix Accessibility issue (1.4.1 Use of Color) by changing some alert colors
- Fix Accessibility issue (1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)) by changing some icon colors when its used with text

## Accessibility Guidelines

- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Ensure the icons tags pass contrast when combined with text.

## Regional Considerations

Some icons that indicate direction will be flipped when in Right-To-Left languages. This is a TODO still.
