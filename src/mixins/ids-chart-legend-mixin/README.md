# Ids Chart Legend Mixin

This mixin adds a legend for charts (or anything that may need one). This includes getters/setters for the legend settings.

1. Include the import for IdsChartLegend in the `mix` list.
1. Set the legendPlacement option as needed (defaults to `bottom`)
1. Call `this.legendTemplate()` to put the legend in the template.
1. Add the import to the sass file `@import '../../mixins/sass/ids-chart-legend-mixin';` to get the styles.
