# IdsMasthead TODOs

## Major

- [ ] Style to the new designs https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise/issues/5661

- [ ] Make example for Standalone css
- [ ] Make example for side-by-side comparison with legacy masthead component
- [ ] Add Initials (username) to example https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/masthead/example-photos.html

## Minor

- [ ] Make an attribute for the more-icon so that it's customizable
- [ ] Fix the way ids-buttons with visible-text appear in the popup menu
