# Ids Tabs Component

## Description

Tabs are a navigation element used to allow users to easily access different areas of a site or different parts of an individual page. A user can navigate between page sections with a tab. Best for communicating different views of the data, or offering navigation between related data.
way to highlight which section/content in a page you are currently
focused on.

## Use Cases

- Used when need information to be highly scannable and to simplify navigation.
- Used when a page needs a more organized structure.

## Features (With Code Examples)

A normal default horizontal tab component.

```html
<ids-tabs value="one">
    <ids-tab value="one">Example One</ids-tab>
    <ids-tab value="two">Example Two</ids-tab>
    <ids-tab value="three">Example Three</ids-tab>
</ids-tabs>
```

A vertical tabs component.
```html
<ids-tabs value="one" orientation="vertical">
    <ids-tab value="one">Example One</ids-tab>
    <ids-tab value="two">Example Two</ids-tab>
    <ids-tab value="three">Example Three</ids-tab>
</ids-tabs>
```

Using a tab context to show the active tab content in `ids-tab-content`.
```html
<ids-tabs-context>
    <!-- ^ context has no outward styling or content, but width/height or display can be set -->
    <ids-tabs value="one">
        <ids-tab value="one">Section 1</ids-tab>
        <ids-tab value="two">Section 2</ids-tab>
        <ids-tab value="three">Section 3</ids-tab>
    </ids-tabs>
    <div class="tab-content">
        <ids-tab-content value="one">
            This will be initially visible
        </ids-tab-content>
        <ids-tab-content value="two">
            If ids-tabs value="two" is selected, or ids-tab with value "two"
            is set as selected, then this will be visible and one will be hidden
        </ids-tab-content>
        <ids-tab-content value="three">
            And this will show if the ids-tabs value or selection becomes "three",
            similar to the previous content entry. Only one will be shown at once.
        </ids-tab-content>
    </div>
</ids-tabs-context>
```

## Settings and Attributes

### Tab Container Settings (`ids-tabs`)
- `disabled` {boolean} disables all tabs.
- `value` {string} set which tab is currently selected. If tab children
do not have a value, will fall back to being a 0-based index. Otherwise, it can
also be any string as long as there are relevant matches for the values.
- `orientation` {'horizontal' | 'vertical'} defaults to horizontal; controls
the direction/axis tabs are flowed on.
- `color-variant` {'alternate'} (optional) sets the color variant to `alternate`; this is used on header components and set automatically when placed inside of an `ids-header` component.

### Individual Tabs Settings (`ids-tab`)
- `disabled` {boolean} allows you to disable a tab among a set of tabs.
- `value` {string | number} the value which when the parent `ids-tabs` also
has an equivalent for, selects this tab.

## Themeable Parts
### IdsTabs
- `container` allows you to style the container of the tab

## States and Variations (With Code Examples)

When placed inside of an `IdsHeader` component, the `ids-tabs` component automatically gains the property `color-variant` which is set to `alternate` as it's default style.

## Keyboard Guidelines

- TAB should move off of the component to the next focusable element on page.
- SHIFT + TAB should move to previous focusable element on the page.
- Direction keys (UP/DOWN for vertical, LEFT/RIGHT for horizontal) should move between tabs
- ENTER should select a tab.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container. Possibly scrolling as needed based on parent dimensions.

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- Tabs was implemented in v4.0.0
- Tabs can be invoked with `$('#my-element').tabs()`.

**4.x to 5.x**

- Tabs are now custom elements `<ids-tabs value=${selection}></ids-tabs>`
- If using events, events are now plain JS events
- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles
- Content within the tabs are specified as `<ids-tab value=${selection-value}>`Tab Label/Content`</ids-tab>`
- Tabs and their panels are now wrapped with a context element `<ids-tabs-context></ids-tabs-context>` for controlling which tab is displayed

## Accessibility Guidelines

## Regional Considerations

Text within tabs should be localized in the current language. They should also should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).
