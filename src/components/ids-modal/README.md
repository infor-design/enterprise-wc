# Ids Modal Component

The Modal Component provides an interface for displaying information, forms, and other content over top of other content on the page.

The IDS Modal Component builds on top of the [Ids Popup](../ids-popup/README.md).

## Use Cases

- Display messages to the user regarding errors, alerts, or other info
- Display small forms that may apply to the next step in a workflow, like inputs/buttons/dropdowns/etc.

## Terminology

**Overlay** The transparent background that exists between the Modal and the page content.  Its opacity can be adjusted.
**Target** Refers to the element that will "trigger" the Modal by click.  This element is optional, as Modals can exist and be triggered by other operations.

## Settings (Attributes)

- `fullsize` used for defining what breakpoint (if any) should cause the modal to transform into full size mode, which takes up 100% width/height of the browser viewport.  Can also be set to `''` (no change) or `always` (always at 100%)
- `visible` can be used to make the Modal show or hide
- `buttons` (readonly) contains a list of references to any Modal Buttons present
- `messageTitle` The text present at the very top of the Modal to indicate its purpose
- `scrollable` If true, allows the "modal-content" element inside the modal to scroll its contents
- `showCloseButton` used to show the close button in modal
- `clickOutsideToClose` {true|false} - Whether or not to allow the modal to close by clicking outside. Default is false

## Themeable Parts

- `modal` allows you to further style or adjust the outer popup element
- `overlay` allows you to adjust the overlay style

## Features (With Code Examples)

To generate a standalone Modal component, simply add an `ids-modal` tag to the page with some content in its default slot.

```html
<ids-modal id="my-modal">
    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>
</ids-modal>
```

This modal can be controlled with Javascript

```js
const modal = document.querySelector('#my-modal');
modal.show();
// ...Modal is displayed

modal.hide();
// ...Modal is hidden
```

### Using a target

Other elements on the page, such as an [Ids Button](../ids-button/README.md) can be used as a triggering element.  In this case, a click event is bound to the defined trigger element that will activate the modal.

```html
<ids-modal id="my-modal">
    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>
</ids-modal>

<ids-button id="trigger-button" appearance="secondary">
    <span>Trigger Modal</span>
    <ids-icon icon="launch"></ids-icon>
</ids-button>
```

```js
const modal = document.querySelector('#my-modal');
const btn = document.querySelector('#trigger-button');
modal.target = btn;

btn.click();
// ...Modal is triggered by its target element
```
### Adding a Message Title and Buttons

It's possible to append a Message Title to add more context, and Buttons to create multiple actions that can be triggered from the Modal.  To do so, take advantage of the Modal's slots:

- The "title" slot, which can be populated by an [IdsText](../ids-text/README.md) or other text element, and will be located at the top of the Modal.
- The "buttons" slot, which can be filled with one or multiple [IdsModalButtons](../ids-modal-button/README.md), and will be located at the bottom of the Modal.

```html
<ids-modal id="my-modal">
    <ids-text slot="title" font-size="24" type="h2">This is the Title</ids-text>
    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>
    <ids-modal-button slot="buttons" id="ok" appearance="primary">OK</ids-modal-button>
    <ids-modal-button slot="buttons" id="cancel" appearance="secondary" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>
</ids-modal>
```

### Displaying in full size mode

IdsModal can alter its display mode to take up 100% of the browser viewport's width/height by using the `fullsize` attribute:

```html
<ids-modal id="my-modal" fullsize="lg">
    <ids-text slot="title" font-size="24" type="h2">Fullsize Modal</ids-text>
    <p>This modal will transform when below the `lg` breakpoint</p>
    <ids-modal-button slot="buttons" id="ok" appearance="primary">OK</ids-modal-button>
    <ids-modal-button slot="buttons" id="cancel" appearance="secondary" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>
</ids-modal>
```

The full size attribute can be defined with an IDS Breakpoint, as defined in the [IdsBreakpointMixin](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/blob/main/src/mixins/ids-breakpoint-mixin/README.md).  Alternatively, this setting can be changed to `null` or `''` resulting in no fullscreen mode, or `'always'` which forces the fullscreen mode to be displayed indefinitely.

By default, the full size setting on all modals is set to Small (`sm`) and will break when the viewport width is below 600px.

### Handling scrolled content

Scrolled content on IdsModal can be configured using the `scrollable` setting.  By default, scrolling is disabled on the internal `ids-modal-content` element, which wraps the slot containing all nested content outside the header and footer areas.  In situations where scrolling is not handled by one of the slotted elements, using `scrollable="true"` will enable the scrolling internally.

If a scrollable element such as [IdsSplitter](../ids-splitter/README.md) has been slotted, a best practice is to defer to that element for scrolling behavior on its own child elements.  In this case, `scrollable` should be set to false.

### Ids Modal Button Component

The IdsModalButton Component is an extension of the regular [IdsButton Component](../ids-button/README.md) that displays the button in a larger style that fits within [IdsModal Components](../ids-modal/README.md). Used to create buttons for use within Modal-type components.

#### States/Attributes

`cancel` a special flag that can be applied to Modal Buttons to more easily identify them as being associated with a "cancelling" action.

#### Code Example

Modal Buttons extend regular buttons and are constructed with similar markup.

```html
<ids-modal-button id="button-ok" appearance="primary">
    <ids-text>OK</ids-text>
</ids-modal-button>
<ids-modal-button id="button-ok" appearance="secondary" cancel>
    <ids-text>Cancel</ids-text>
</ids-modal-button>
```
