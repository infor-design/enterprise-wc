## Keyboard Guidelines
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> - Tabbing will tab across the header elements and into the monthview.
- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> reverses the direction of the tab order.
- <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> goes to the same day of the week in the previous or next week respectively. If the user advances past the end of the month they continue into the next or previous month as appropriate
- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> advances one day to the next, also in a continuum. Visually, focus is moved from day to day and wraps from row to row in a grid of days and weeks
- <kbd>Control + Page Up</kbd> moves to the same date in the previous year
- <kbd>Control + Page Down</kbd> moves to the same date in the next year
- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves to the first day of the current month
- <kbd>End</kbd> moves to the last day of the current month
- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> moves to the same date in the previous month
- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> moves to the same date in the next month
- <kbd>T</kbd> moves to today's date

## Features (With Code Examples)

```

```html
<ids-month-view

></ids-month-view>
```

The component can be controlled dynamically

```js
const monthView = document.querySelector('ids-month-view');

// Changing month (March)
monthView.month = 2;

// Changing day
monthView.day = 4;

// Changing year
monthView.year = 2016;

// Changing first day of the week (Monday)
monthView.firstDayOfWeek = 1;

// Make it compact
monthView.compact = true;

// Showing date range
monthView.startDate = '07/14/2021';
monthView.endDate = '02/02/2022';

// Set legend
monthView.legend = [
  {
    name: 'Public Holiday',
    color: 'emerald-60',
    dates: ['12/31/2021', '12/24/2021', '1/1/2022'],
  },
  { name: 'Weekends', color: 'amber-60', dayOfWeek: [0, 6] },
  {
    name: 'Other',
    color: 'ruby-30',
    dates: ['1/8/2022', '1/9/2022', '1/23/2022'],
  },
  {
    name: 'Half Days',
    color: 'amethyst-60',
    dates: ['1/21/2022', '1/22/2022'],
  },
  {
    name: 'Full Days',
    color: '#1677ee',
    dates: ['1/24/2022', '1/25/2022'],
  }
];

// Unset legend
monthView.legend = null;
```

## Accessibility

The monthview is a very complex component to code for accessibility. We take the following approach:

- Add an `aria-label` to the calendar element
- Add `aria-selected=true` to selected day
- Each calendar item should have an audible label to announce the day of week while arrowing through days
- For comparison, see a similar <a href="http://oaa-accessibility.org/example/15/" target="_blank">example</a>
