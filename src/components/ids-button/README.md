# Ids Button Component

## Description

The IDS Button component is a simple wrapper around a standard HTMLButtonElement that is styled with Infor branding, and contains some additional API that makes it easy to set text, icons, and functionality.

## Use Cases

- Create standalone buttons
- Create multiple buttons, each with different styling to provide context for actions that are primary, secondary, and tertiary.

## Terminology

**Primary**: A primary action that is the definitive "use" of a particular feature.  For example, after doing data entry on a form, the primary action might be to "Save" the contents of that form to a record.
**Secondary**: A secondary action is one that might be related to the primary action, but alternative in nature.  For example, a secondary action that might sit next to our above primary action could be "reset", which would remove the user-entered contents of the form and start from scratch.
**Tertiary**: Sometimes also called "destructive" in IDS, a tertiary action is one that might "undo" or be completely separate from the primary/secondary actions, but labelled with enough importance to be displayed aside them. Building on the above examples, a tertiary action might be "cancel" or "close", which would cause the form to close, and return the user to the previous workflow.

## Themeable Parts

- `button` allows you to further style the internal button element
- `icon` allows you to further style the internal icon element (used in some types of buttons)
- `text` allows you to further style the internal icon element (used in some types of buttons)

## Features (With Code Samples)

Standalone primary buttons could be built this way:

```html
<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

Add an icon to the button using the `icon` attribute:

```html
<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary" icon="settings">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

IDS Buttons can be designed to make the icon appear by itself, without any visible text.  For accessibility reasons, descriptive text explaining the button's function should always be present.  In this scenario, the text span can have an "audible" class added, which will visually hide the text, but keep it accessible to screen readers:

```html
<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary" icon="settings">
  <span class="audible">My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

### Color Variants

If placing a button inside a container with a contrasting background color, sometimes the "base" styles for Ids Button appearances aren't adequate for passing contrast checks. To resolve this problem, the `color-variant` property can be used by way of the [IdsColorVariantMixin](../../mixins/ids-color-variant-mixin/README.md):

```html
<!-- Generates a default (Tertiary) Button with white text and focus/hover states --->
<ids-button id="my-button-1" color-variant="alternate">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>

<!-- Generates a Primary Button with a slightly more bright Azure --->
<ids-button id="my-button-2" appearance="primary" color-variant="alternate">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>

<!-- Generates a Secondary Button with a slightly more bright Slate --->
<ids-button id="my-button-3" appearance="primary" color-variant="alternate">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>

<!-- Generates a button to use with toolbar formatter type --->
<ids-button id="my-button-4" color-variant="alternate-formatter">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

## States and Variations

Standard button states include:

- Normal
- Hover
- Focus
- Active (pressed)
- Disabled
- Color Variant - alternate colors for each button appearance are available via the [IdsColorVariantMixin](../../src/mixins/ids-color-variant/README.md)

IDS button appearances include:

- `default` (not displayed as a "appearance" attribute when set)
- `primary`
- `primary-destructive`
- `secondary`
- `tertiary`
- `tertiary-destructive`

### Alignment

By default, alignment of text/icons within an IDS Button will occur based on the DOM order of those elements.  However, if the `icon-align` attribute is specified, the alignment order of the inner elements can be forced.

The example below will result in the icon appearing after the text, even though the DOM order is the opposite:

```html
<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary" icon="settings" icon-align="end">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

The attribute has the following effects:

| prop value | LTR (default) Icon Location | RTL Icon Location |
| :--------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |
| undefined  | n/a | n/a |
| 'start'    | icon to the left of text | icon to the right of text |
| 'end'      | icon to the right of text | icon to the left of text |

### Type

IdsButton's type attribute simply passes through to the Shadow Root's HTMLButtonElement and defines its usage.  For example, this is how you would define a form's `submit` button:

```html
<ids-button id="my-button" type="submit">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

## Settings and Attributes

- `appearance` {string} The visual style defining the purpose of the button
- `colorVariant` {'alternate' | 'alternate-formatter'} Set the variants theme styles
- `cssClass` {Array<string> | string | null} Contains space-delimited CSS classes (or an array of CSS classes) that will be passed to the Shadow Root button
- `disabled` {boolean} Sets the internal Button element's `disabled` property to enable/disable the button
- `icon` {string | null} A string representing an icon to display inside the button.  This string is passed to a slotted [IdsIcon](../ids-icon/README.md) element's `icon` setting to set the desired icon type.
- `iconAlign` {string} Defines which side to align the Button's icon against, can be 'start' or 'end'
- `tabIndex` {string | number} Sets the internal Button element's `tabIndex` property for controlling focus
- `text` {string} API-level method of setting a button's text content. This will become the content of the slotted text node when set
- `type` {string} Passes a 'type' attribute for a standard HTMLButtonElement into the IdsButton's ShadowRoot-contained button element
- `tooltip` {string} Sets up a string based tooltip
- `square` {boolean} whether the corners of the button as an icon-button are angled/90Â°
- `width` {string} Sets width of button. Accepts percent, pixels, rem, etc.

## Keyboard Guidelines

The IDS Button doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLButtonElement:

- <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys execute the action for that button. If the button activation closes the containing entity or launches another entity, then focus moves to the newly-opened entity. If the button activation does not close or dismiss the containing entity, then focus remains on the button. An example might be an "Apply" or "Recalculate" button.
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Tab<kbd> causes focus to move away from the button forward or backward one element/set respectively.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Buttons can optionally be 100% width of their parent container on mobile breakpoints

## Accessibility Guidelines

- All buttons, including icon-only buttons, should have some kind of text description inside the button for explaining its action to a visually-impaired user. This text can be hidden visually by way of using an `audible` CSS class on the text content.

## Regional Considerations

Be conscious of the layout of content within your buttons when they are present in RTL situations.

## Converting from Previous Versions

**3.x to 4.x**
- Change class `inforFormButton` default to `btn-primary`
- Change class `inforFormButton` to `btn-secondary

**4.x to 5.x**
The IDS Button component is now a WebComponent.  Instead of using classes to define a button's purpose or visual style, it's now done directly with an "appearance" attribute:

```html
<!-- 4.x button example -->
<button class="btn-primary" id="my-button">
  <svg class="icon" role="presentation">
    <use href="#settings"></use>
  </svg>
  <span>My Button</span>
</button>

<!-- this is the same button using the WebComponent -->
<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary" icon="settings">
  <span>My Button</span>
</ids-button>
```

- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-button id="my-button" appearance="primary"></ids-button>`
- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.
- Some button properties are now attributes - "appearance", "text", "icon", "disabled", etc.
- Some components now extend IdsButton, such as [IdsToggleButton](../ids-toggle-button/README.md) and [IdsMenuButton](../ids-menu-button/README.md)...
