# ids-icon 

## Description

The design system provides a list of standard icons which can be used in your applications. The list of icons is a result of a studying common iconography and consolidating that with standardized icons (for example, a floppy disk to represent a "save" function). The icons in the list should be familiar to users.

## Use Cases

- Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.
- Use too many icons and they'll become nothing more than decoration. Their use for navigation on a webpage can often cause dilution.

## Terminology

- **Icon**: An icon is a symbol. In this design case this is literal, for example  the little trashcan to indicate delete.
- **Svg**: Stands for eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector graphic format for the Web and other environments

## Methods

- `appendSVGDefs(SVGDefsElement | string)` Appends additional SVGDefs to the icon's SVG element to allow SVG customization.

## Features (With Code Examples)

For a normal sized icon just specific the icon name and the web component will display the appropriate icon.

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes"></ids-icon>
```

Icons come in 6 sizes depending where it is used.

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="xxl"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="xl"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="large"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="medium"></ids-icon>
<!-- Used only for extreme edge cases -->
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="small"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" size="xsmall"></ids-icon>
```

Icons can also have a color that can be used for embellishment or to indicate status or bring attention to data. These should not be confused with `ids-alert` icons which are used in error messages / validation messages and for alert/errors. These should be used for softer embellishment and do not replace alert icons where these are shown in examples (i.e. validation messages). Valid values are 'error' | 'warning' | 'caution' | 'info' | 'success' | 'neutral' | 'red' | 'yellow' | 'green' | 'blue' | 'teal' | 'purple' | 'white' | 'black'

```html
<ids-icon icon="rocket" status-color="blue"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="money" status-color="blue"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="info" status-color="blue"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="success" status-color="success"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="error" status-color="error"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="alert" status-color="warning"></ids-icon>
```

Icons also have offer notification badge options in 4 possible positions

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-right"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="bottom-left"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="bottom-right"></ids-icon>
```

These badges can also be displayed in 5 possible colors

```html
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left" badge-color="base"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left" badge-color="info"></ids-icon>
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left"></ids-icon badge-color="warning">
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left"></ids-icon badge-color="success">
<ids-icon icon="notes" badge-position="top-left" badge-color="error"></ids-icon>
```

Add a custom icons by importing a custom icon file in the same format we use. The format of the json file is something like:

```json
{
  "my-icon1": "<path d=\"m7 16.81-1.57-1 .49-9L.83 3.37s-.51-1.51 1-1.56c1 .63 5.09 3.33 5.09 3.33l7.8-4.33 1.62 1-5.87 5.64 3.36 2.14 2.11-.9 1.31.85-.44.72-1.56 1-.39.63-.19 1.82-.45.73-1.31-.86-.07-2.36L9.45 9.1Z\"></path>",
  "my-icon2": "<path d=\"m17.54 12.23-1.42 1H3.1l-2-2.6h16.42ZM3.32 8.85h2.74V7H3.32Zm4.78 0h2.74V7H8.1Zm8.56 1.62V5.19h-3.4v5.21\"></path>"
}
```

We recommend you use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to optimize your SVG before adding them to IdsIcon. In particular inline colors and transforms can causes issues rendering the icons in buttons and other places.

To import the file use the IdsIcon static api. The file only needs to be imported once because this is static then it can be used everywhere on the page or in your framework if you do it in the right place like app startup.

```js
import customIconJSON from './custom-icon-data.json';

// May need to fetch the file with ajax...
IdsIcon.customIconData = customIconData; // JSON String
```

One the files are imported they can be used like a normal ids-icon

```html
<ids-icon icon="my-icon1" size="large"></ids-icon>
```

## States and Variations

- Color
- Size
- Alert
- Badge-Position
- Badge-Color
- Status-Color
- Height
- Viewbox
- Width

## Keyboard Guidelines

An icon is not on its own keyboard focusable and has no keyboard interaction.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Flows within its parent/placement and is usually centered vertically.

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- Icons have all new markup and classes.

**4.x to 5.x**

- The Icon component has been changed to a web component
- You no longer need the huge block of svg in the page.
- The icon and size are set via properties/attributes
- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-icon></ids-icon>` (see examples above)
- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles
- If using events, events are now plain JS events.
- Can now display notification badge (combines this feature)
- Can now be used to display empty-message options
- The logos have been removed/deprecated.
- The pseudo elements have been removed/deprecated.

## Accessibility Guidelines

- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. Ensure the icons tags pass contrast when combined with text.

## Regional Considerations

Some icons that indicate direction will be flipped when in Right-To-Left languages. This is a TODO still.
