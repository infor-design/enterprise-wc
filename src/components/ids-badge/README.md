## Description

## Terminology

- **Badge**: Used to inform users of the status of an object or of an action.
- **Color**: This is the color of the badge.
- **Shape**: This is the shape of the badge. It can be round or rounded rectangle.

## Themeable Parts

- `badge` allows you to further style the badge element

## Features (With Code Examples)

A normal/no properties badge used as a web component.

```html
<ids-badge>5</ids-badge>
```

Use the `color` attribute to style badges as statuses:
`alert`, `error`, `info`, `warning`, or `success`.

```html
<ids-badge color="caution">10</ids-badge>
<ids-badge color="error">1500</ids-badge>
<ids-badge color="info">25k+</ids-badge>
<ids-badge color="warning">16</ids-badge>
<ids-badge color="success">5</ids-badge>
```

To create a circular badge, use the `shape` attribute with the value `round`:

```html
<ids-badge color="caution" shape="round">10</ids-badge>
```

For improved accessibility, add an audible description using <ids-text>:

```html
<ids-badge color="error">404 <ids-text audible="true">In Error Condition</ids-text></ids-badge>
```
