# ids-alert

## Description

IDS Alert icons are special icons that indicate a status/error situation. They can are often used as one part of an error/alert/info message with accompanying text. Alerts help get users attention of something affecting an application, feature or a page. This component consists of different types such as `error`, `warning`, `success`, and `info` that represents the icon color for each status.

## Use Cases

Typically, these alerts are use to get attention of the status of your application. Use text along with the alert so that users that cant understand the color difference get the important alert information.

Alerts should be used for error messages and warnings not as embellishments. For a softer status, something like an embellishment see icons component status colors. Note that the badges should not be used in place of alerts or status icons and do not support icons.

## Terminology

- **Type**: Type is basically the status of an alert.
- **Icon**: Icon is the symbol of the alert.
- **Color**: The type of alert color.

```

An alert can be used in a disabled situation so comes with a disabled style

```html
<ids-alert icon="info" disabled="true"></ids-alert>
```

## Accessibility

The traffic light colors are accessibility violations for contrast, however, the high contrast theme provides an alternative that passes. In addition, in context text should be used as color alone cannot provide the meaning. i.e. Do not use color alone to indicate a state.
