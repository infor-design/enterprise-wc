## Keyboard Guidelines

The swipe action is not keyboard friendly. For this we use the actions button for keyboard users.

## Responsive Guidelines

- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container.
- The swipe does work to a limited degree on chrome via a scroll action. But it is not the most user friendly interaction. For this we use the actions button for keyboard users.
