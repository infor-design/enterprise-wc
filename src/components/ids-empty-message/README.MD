# Ids Empty Message Component

## Description

The IDS Empty Message component is a layout pattern for indicating there is no data for the object. Empty messages appear in ids-cards, ids-data-grid and other places like forms. The component supports action buttons, provides styling for a label and secondary description and optional empty-message specific icons.

## Use Cases

- When no content is present, an empty message is useful to communicate information & action. It is critical to communicate why itâ€™s empty and what the user can do.
## Terminology
- **icon**: this property when included and provided with a supported icon id will display the chosen icon in the empty message format
- **label**: this is a web component slot, the contents of this slot are treated as a primary label and are styled accordingly
- **description**: this is a web component slot, the contents of this slot are formatted as secondary text in the ids-empty-message format
- **button**: this is a slot that is used for any button inputs for the empty message

## Themeable Parts

- `container` allows for the styling of the container element

## Features

A simple implementation of the empty-message component

```html

    <ids-text label="true" slot="description">Description of empty message that explains why and possible contain a hyperlink.</ids-text>
    <ids-button class="action-button" slot="button" appearance="primary">
