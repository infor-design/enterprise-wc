## Features (With Code Samples)

A standard upload advanced element:

```html

```

Set the whole upload advanced element to disabled. Note that making the component `disabled` while currently in the process of uploading, will not stop uploading.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced disabled="true"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set to hide the browse link:

```html
<ids-upload-advanced show-browse-link="false"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set to not allow automatic start of upload after files have been dropped or added via browser.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced auto-start="false"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set custom icon in main drop area:

```html
<ids-upload-advanced icon="cloud"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Add limit the file types (.png, .jpg):

```html
<ids-upload-advanced accept=".png, .jpg"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set max file size (in bytes), can be uploaded. An error will be shown if the file is over the limit.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced max-file-size="2097152"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set max number of files in total, that can be uploaded:

```html
<ids-upload-advanced max-files="5"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set max files can be in process uploading at one time.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced max-files-in-process="2"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set custom param name, that might be used to read data from a server API.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced param-name="someCustomParamName"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set the custom text strings using the named slots.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced>
  <span slot="text-btn-cancel">Cancel</span>
  <span slot="text-btn-close-error">Close</span>
  <span slot="text-btn-remove">Remove</span>
  <span slot="text-droparea">Drag and Drop Here</span>
  <span slot="text-droparea-with-browse">Drag/Drop here or Click {browseLink} to Browse.</span>
  <span slot="text-droparea-with-browse-link">here</span>
  <span slot="text-progress-label">{percent}% ({loaded}) loaded form total {size} - {file-name}</span>
</ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set the custom error strings this way:

```html
<ids-upload-advanced accept=".png" max-files="5" max-files-in-process="2" max-file-size="1000000">
  <span slot="error-max-files">Max files error</span>
  <span slot="error-max-files-in-process">Max files in process error</span>
  <span slot="error-accept-file-type">Limit file types error</span>
  <span slot="error-max-file-size">Max file size error</span>
  <span slot="error-url">Required URL error</span>
  <span slot="error-xhr-headers">XHRHeaders error</span>
</ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set extra headers to send with XHR, when use component `XMLHttpRequest` to send files. XHR Headers must be a valid JSON string contains array of name/value objects.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced>
  <span slot="xhr-headers">[{ "name": "header1", "value": "header1-value" }]</span>
</ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set the url to use component `XMLHttpRequest` to send files:

```html
<ids-upload-advanced url="http://somedomain.com/upload"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

Set the method, when use component `XMLHttpRequest` method to send files. The default is set `POST`, it can be set to `PUT`.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced method="PUT"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

You can also set the custom `Send()` method with the JS api.

```html
<ids-upload-advanced id="some-id"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

```javascript
// Custom send method
function customSendMethodXhr(formData, uiElem) {
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  // attach ui method to set updates
  xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress', uiElem.progressHandler.bind(uiElem), false);
  xhr.addEventListener('load', uiElem.completeHandler.bind(uiElem), false);
  xhr.addEventListener('error', uiElem.errorHandler.bind(uiElem), false);
  xhr.addEventListener('abort', uiElem.abortHandler.bind(uiElem), false);

  xhr.open('POST', 'http://somedomain/upload'); // Using post method
  xhr.send(formData);

  // File abort
  uiElem?.addEventListener('abort', () => {
    xhr.abort();
  });
}

// Attach this custom send method, to upload element.
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const uploadEl = document.querySelector('#some-id');
  uploadEl.send = customSendMethodXhr;
});
```

Set an arbitrary error message.

```html
<ids-button id="error-btn" type="secondary">
  <span slot="text">Set Error</span>
</ids-button>
<ids-upload-advanced id="error-el"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

```javascript
const errorBtn = document.querySelector('#error-btn');
const errorEl = document.querySelector('#error-el');
errorBtn?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  errorEl.setError({ message: 'Arbitrary error message' });
});
```

Set an arbitrary error message on each file.

```html
<ids-button id="error-files-btn" type="secondary">
  <span slot="text">Set Error on each file</span>
</ids-button>
<ids-upload-advanced id="error-files-el"></ids-upload-advanced>
```

```javascript
const errorFilesBtn = document.querySelector('#error-files-btn');
const errorFilesEl = document.querySelector('#error-files-el');
errorFilesBtn?.addEventListener('click', () => {
  // fileNodes: can be use `all`, `notStarted`, `inProcess`
  const fileNodes: any[] = errorFilesEl.all;
  if (fileNodes.length) {
    errorFilesEl.setError({ message: 'File arbitrary error message', fileNodes });

- Its set as `block` element with `100%` width, so set the desired width on parent container in order to set the width.

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- FileUploadAdvanced was a new component created in v4.2.0

**4.x to 5.x**

- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-upload-advanced></ids-upload-advanced>`
- Each file's UI sections are represented by their own custom elements `<ids-upload-advanced-file></ids-upload-advanced-file>`
- Each file's status can be observed by simple component properties, like `value`, `error`, or `size`.
- If using events, events are now plain JS events.
- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.

```html
<!-- 4.x fileupload-advanced example -->
<div class="field">
  <div class="fileupload-advanced" data-options="{allowedTypes: 'jpg|png|gif'}">
</div>

<!-- This is the same upload-advanced using a WebComponent -->
<ids-upload-advanced accept=".jpg, .png, .gif"></ids-upload-advanced>
```
