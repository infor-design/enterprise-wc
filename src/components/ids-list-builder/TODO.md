# IdsListBuilder TODOs

## Major

- [] Better keyboard support for all actions
- [] Can't create a new item if no items in the list initially
- [] Can multiselect but delete removes one at a time (select one, delete, select another, delete, select another, delete)
- [] Editing style needs design review
- [] Add same events as the prod component `move`, `selected`, `click`, `doubleclick` `change`, `add`, `beforeAdd`, `afterAdd`, `delete` `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete`
- [] Hover state in high contrast mode is 100% black

## Medium

- [] Correct aria [see standards](https://design.infor.com/code/ids-enterprise/latest/listview#accessibility)
- [] A way to save order / events
- [] Make focus state on buttons white with box shadow
- [] More test coverage
