# Ids Slider Component

## Description

Displays a range of selectable values(s) between a minimum and maximum, which can be controlled by the thumb(s) along the track of the slider. There is a single slider (1 thumb), double slider (2 thumbs), and a step slider (1 thumb and x amount of ticks). They can also be converted from horizontal (default) to vertical orientation. The value(s) can be modified by either clicking the area around the track, by dragging the thumb back and forth, or by focusing and pressing the arrow keys.  A user can select a single value or range of values.

## Use Cases

- Control an input with limited options through clicking/dragging/keyboard interaction.
- Best for showing a user's current selection relative to the lower and upper limits of a scale.

## Terminology

- **Minimum**: The smallest value possible, on one end of the slider
- **Maximum**: The largest value possible, on the other end of the slider
- **Thumb**: The circular button that can be dragged back and forth on the slider to control input
- **Tick**: The dots along the step slider that indicate the amount of choices for input
- **Track**: The bar which the thumb moves along
- **Track area**: The area around the track which can be clicked to modify the input value

## Settings (Attributes)

- `value` {number} set the primary value of the slider
- `value-secondary` {number} set the secondary value of the slider (applicable only for double slider)
- `min` {number} set the minimum value of the slider
- `max` {number} set the maximum value of the slider
- `color` {string} set the color of the slider
- `type` {'single' | 'double' | 'step'} set the type of the slider
- `step-number` {number >= 2} number of steps (applicable only for the step slider)
- `vertical` {boolean}

## Settings (Non-attributes)

- `labels` {array} set the list of labels you want (applicable only for step slider)

### How to set the labels

In order for the labels to be set, the `type` attribute must be set to `step`, and the attribute `step-number` must match the size of the array of labels. Javascript is required to inject the label array into the DOM.

```js
this.labels = ['very bad, poor, average, good, excellent']; // where 'this' is the ids-slider

document.querySelector('ids-slider').labels = ['very bad, poor, average, good, excellent']; // you can also do this
```

Based on the example above, the attribute `step-number` would need to be set to `5`

## Accessibility

Users can tab to focus on the thumb with <kbd>Tab<kbd> and modify values with <kbd>Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd>.

## Features (With Code Samples)

```html
<ids-slider value="50" min="0" max="100"></ids-slider>

- The slider has a minimum height of 300px (vertical orientation)

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- Slider was a new component in v4.0.0
- Slider can be invoked with `$('#my-element').slider();`

**4.x to 5.x**

- Slider is now a custom element `<ids-slider></ids-slider>`
- Slider options are avaiable as attributes (such as `vertical`, `type`, etc)

### Converting from 4.x

```html
<div class="field">
  <label for="slider-regular-example">Regular</label>
  <input id="slider-regular-example" name="slider-regular" class="slider" type="range"/>
</div>
```
is the 4.x equivalent of the web component example below

```html
<ids-slider type="single"></ids-slider>
```
