# ids-treemap

## Description

Treemaps are used to display hierarchical data. This is useful when space is constrained and you need to see an overview of a large amount of hierarchical data. Treemaps should primarily be used with values that can be aggregated. Treemaps are economical in that they can be used within a limited space and yet display a large number of items simultaneously. When there is a correlation between color and size in the tree structure, you are able to see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, for example, when a certain color is particularly relevant.

Treemaps are not good when there is a big difference in the magnitude of the measure values. Nor is a treemap the right choice when mixing absolute and relative values. Negative values cannot be displayed in treemaps.

## Terminology
**result** This is a property / attr where the treemap data object gets stored.
**title** This is an attribute where the treemap title is stored.

## Features (With Code Examples)

```html
    <ids-treemap title="Storage Utilization (78 GB)"></ids-treemap>
```

```js
const treeMapEl = document.querySelector('ids-treemap');

  treeMapEl.result = treeMapEl.treeMap({
    data: [
      {
        value: 28,
        color: '#003876',
        text: 'JSON',
        label: '28%'
      },
      {
        value: 18,
        color: '#004A99',
        text: 'PDF',
        label: '18%'
      },
      {
        value: 8,
        color: '#0054B1',
        text: 'BOD',
        label: '8%'
      },
      {
        value: 8,
        color: '#0066D4',
        text: 'TXT',
        label: '8%'
      },
      {
        value: 17,
        color: '#0072ED',
        text: 'CSV',
        label: '17%'
      },
      {
        value: 7,
        color: '#1C86EF',
        text: 'Assets',
        label: '7%'
      },
      {
        value: 14,
        color: '#55A3F3',
        text: 'Others',
        label: '14%'
      },
    ],
    width: 1000, // Optional. By default takes the width of the container.
    height: 300
  });
```

## Accessibility Guidelines

The contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing different contrast colors in the color option.

## Usage Guidance

- **data** Required. The data format should be as follows:
```js
{
    data: [{
        value: 28,
        color: '#003876',
        text: 'JSON',
        label: '28%'
      },
      {
        value: 18,
        color: '#004A99',
        text: 'PDF',
        label: '18%'
      }
    ],
    height: 300
}
```

- **width** By default the treemap takes on the width of the container. The treemap will resize as the screen size changes.
= **height** Required. You will need to set the height for the treemap.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

This chart has no keyboard functionality

## Responsive Information

As you resize the chart will redraw with in the width of the container width. The nodes in the treemap are sized in proportion.
