```html
<ids-hyperlink href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Normal Link</ids-hyperlink>
```

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- Used a css class on `<a>` tags

**4.x to 5.x**

- The Hyperlink component has been changed to a web component
- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-hyperlink></ids-hyperlink>` (see examples above)
- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles
- If using events, events are now plain JS events.
- The directional links have been removed/deprecated.

## Accessibility Guidelines

- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.

## Regional Considerations

Link text should be localized in the current language. And should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).
