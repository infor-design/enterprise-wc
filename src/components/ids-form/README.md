# Ids Form Component

## Description

The Form component is an Ids Web Component that provides some functionality similar to an Html form elements. Form adds the ability to link a submit button. When the form is submitted the submit event is fired in which you can do what is needed with the form data. The form also allows you to  toggle the `compact` mode. And get which form fields have been changed (dirty) and reset this. You can also see which fields have errors with the API. The layout of the page is handled by the `ids-layout-grid` component.

## Use Cases

- When you want to submit a group of form data to the backend
- When you want to know which fields in a form are dirty or invalid.

## Terminology

- **Form**: An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
- **Validation Messages**: Input errors a field might have
- **isDirty**:  Form or field has been changed from its original value
- **inValid**: Form or field has one or more errors

## Features (With Code Examples)

A simple form web component would have an `id` and a `submit-button` property that links to the button on the page. The submit button should be a primary type of button. You might also set `compact` mode if you have a large form and not much space, but its recommended to use the larger/normal size fields in most cases, and for better mobile experience.

```html
    <ids-form compact="false" submit-button="btn-submit" id="sample-form">
      <ids-layout-grid cols="2" gap="md">
        <ids-layout-grid-cell>
          <ids-input id="field-1" label="Field One"></ids-input>
          <ids-input id="field-2" label="Field Two"></ids-input>

          <ids-button id="btn-submit" appearance="primary">
            <span>Submit</span>
          </ids-button>
        </ids-layout-grid-cell>
        <ids-layout-grid-cell>
          <ids-input id="field-3" label="Field Three"></ids-input>
          <ids-input id="field-4" label="Field Four"></ids-input>

        </ids-layout-grid-cell>
      </ids-layout-grid>
    </ids-form>
```

## Keyboard Guidelines

- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: Allows you to tab around the form components.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: If on the button with submit the form. We might later allow enter to submit the form from anywhere in the form. If this is requested.

## Responsive Guidelines

- See `ids-layout-grid` for details as this is the layout driver for forms

## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)

**3.x to 4.x**

- Forms were first implemented in v4.0.0 in this version you just used a `<form>` element.

**4.x to 5.x**

- Forms are now custom elements `<ids-form>...</ids-form>`
- If using events events are now plain JS events. `submit`
- Folks using reactive forms in angular will need to give us feedback.
- The previous version just had forms as layouts, now the form has more functionality.

## Regional Considerations

Labels should be localized in the current language. The fields in the form will flip the direction of the fields but these are details of the `ids-layout-grid` component.
