# Ids Draggable TODOs

## Major

- [] Support mobile touch
- [] Document: ids-drag event: e.detail.parentRect, e.detail.dragDeltaX/Y, e.detail translateX/Y
- [] Fix known issue (minor): in firefox, the cursor when moved quickly flashes between dragging/default as the positioning/detection isn't instant as it is in chrome.
- [] Support for dragging datagrid columns (is clone needed)
- [] Support for dragging with handles (row reorder)

## Minor

- [] Does it need keyboard support
