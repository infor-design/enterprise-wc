# Ids Week View TODO

Keep this file in sync with #572

## Major

- [x] [One-Day View](https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/week-view/example-one-day.html)
- [x] [Two-Day View](https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/week-view/example-two-day.html)
- [x] [Two-Week View](https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/week-view/example-two-weeks.html)

## Minor

- [x] Bug: Timeline Interval isn't displayed when the page first loads (only on subsequent time intervals or page changes)
- [x] Add weekview events - rendered, weekrendered, click, dblclick
- [x] Add demo that populates a WeekView with an AJAX call (look at the dropdown ajax example) - beforeWeekRendered
