## 1.0.0-beta.19

### 1.0.0-beta.19 Breaking Changes

- `[ChartLegendMixin]` Added `none` as a legend placement setting and made it default, allowing the legend to be completely hidden.

([#1672](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/issues/1672))

- `[Colors]` Any components that use colors as a setting now use a generic color names instead of previous color words.
