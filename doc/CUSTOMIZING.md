# Customizing IDS Web Components

IDS Web Components are designed according to IDS Guidelines. The latest version includes the newest default design out of the box and should blend well in any Infor Application or Application in general. We also provide a lot of options for customization within each component, so check the component docs for the various settings. However, we also have a few ways to customize the look and behavior of
components to further assist with your application's needs. This page outlines the ways you can customize the components beyond the built in look and settings.

## Slots

Many components have either a default slot or a named slot. For more info on slots see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot). You can fill either the default slot or named slots with other elements.

For example using the default slot you could add more content inside it.

```html
<ids-text font-size="16">Settings <ids-icon icon="settings"></ids-icon></ids-text>
```

For example using the named slot you could add more content inside it. Like an icon in the accordion header. You may need css to lay this out but could use `ids-layout-grid` or `ids-layout-flex` to do some layout.

```html
<ids-accordion-header slot="header">
  <ids-text font-size="16">Settings <ids-icon icon="settings"></ids-icon></ids-text>
</ids-accordion-header>
```

## Styling Css Shadow Parts

Each component exposes a range of [CSS Shadow Parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) (see the readme.md or code header for each component). For example the [tooltip component](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/blob/main/src/components/ids-tooltip/ids-tooltip.ts#L76) exposes the main internal panel that gives you a way to style it externally. Keep in mind our components have full css encapsulation so this is one additional way. If you find a place where a `::part` is needed feel free to make an issue or pull request.

You can target this shadow part with a css selector like this using the tooltip ID and the `::part`.

```css
ids-tooltip[target='#tooltip-parts']::part(tooltip) {
  font-weight: 300;
  text-transform: capitalize;
}
```

## Extending Component Classes

Since our code base is Typescript it is possible to full extend any component and add additional functionality. The basic idea is is..

```js
import IdsCalendarEvent from '../node_modules/ids-enterprise/components/ids-calendar/ids-calendar-event';

export default class IdsCustomCalendarEvent extends IdsCalendarEvent {
 ...
}
```

Once you do this you can then override or add any methods. Such as the `template` which will let you fully change the markup. You can also append a style sheet into the shadow root or do any overrides.

This technique is flexible but susceptible to problems or needing updates as we make future updates or changes to the internals.

## Reusing Mixins

Another possibility is to reuse some of the "sub-functionality" of our components. We tried to create a series of reusable "mixins" that add functionality. For a list of mixins see [src/mixins](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/tree/main/src/mixins). For example you could use the tooltip mixin to add a tooltip option to your custom component or the chart legend mixin to add a legend to your own chart in the matching style.

## Theming

We are in the process of adding full css theming via a comprehensive series of (css variables)[https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/issues/1118]. This work is in progress and expected to be completed before initial go live on version 1.0. You would be able to customize css variables at any level using css inheritance. For example:

```css
--ids-color-primary: var(--ids-color-azure-70);
...
--ids-text-color: var(--ids-color-slate-100);
...
--ids-component-background-color: var(--ids-color-slate-00);
```
