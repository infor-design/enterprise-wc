        "value": "# Ids Popup Component\n\nThe IDS Popup Component allows for the placement of any HTML content in a fixed/absolute-positioned container anywhere on a page.  The component provides API for setting coordinates, or aligning the container in relation to a \"parent\" element on the page.  Additional API exists for modifying alignment, visibility, and controlling animation.\n\nThis component is a building-block component for many \"placeable\" IDS Components, such as the [Popup Menu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) and [Modal](../ids-modal/README.md)\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Placing HTML content using X/Y coordinates\n- Placing HTML content against a target element and using X/Y offsets\n\n## Terminology\n\n### Alignment\n\n**Align Target** Defines an external element that serves as a \"triggering\" element for the Popup.\n**Align Edge** Also called the \"primary alignment\", given two alignment values, the first one is the edge of an Align Target that the Popup will be placed against immediately. For example \"bottom\" will cause the Popup to be aligned at the bottom of the Align Target.\n**Primary Alignment** See \"Align Edge\"\n**Secondary Alignment** Given two alignment values, the secondary alignment is optional, and will cause the Popup to line up the given edge with the Align Target's given edge.  For example, given `top, left`, the secondary alignment will cause the Popup to align primarily to the top of the Align Target, but will also line up both the Popup and the Align Targets' left edges.\n\n### Other\n\n**Arrow** Popups can optionally display arrows that can point to content when used with an Align Target.\n**Arrow Target** The element that a Popup's Arrow will point toward.  This defaults to an Align Target, but can also be defined separately.\n**Bleeds** Determines when Popups are allowed to exist outside their defined Containing Element.  A Popup that does not bleed will remain contained, no matter what coordinates/offsets are provided.\n**Containing Element** Popups are confined to a contained area inside of a page.  This area may be the entire document body,\nan [IDS Container](../ids-container/README.md), or a custom-defined element.  If bleeding is disabled, the Popup will never cross the boundaries of the container.\n**Coordinates** When placed directly in a page (not aligned against an element), a Popup uses its provided x/y values as coordinates as if plotted on a graph.\n**Offsets** When placed against a parent element, a Popup uses its provided x/y values as offsets from the base position detected.\n**Type** Defines the style of Popup that can be used.  There are several different display types, the most common one being `menu`.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `popup` allows you to further style or adjust the outer popup element\n- `arrow` allows you to adjust the arrow element\n\n## Features (with code samples)\n\nCreating a Context-menu style that would open on click might look like the following:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\" x=\"0\" y=\"10\" align=\"top, left\">\n  <div slot=\"content\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n```\n\nTo create a Popup that appears to align itself against a button, you could do the following:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\" x=\"10\" y=\"10\" align=\"top, left\" alignTarget=\"#my-button\">\n  <div slot=\"content\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n\n...\n\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n### Using Visibility\n\nDisplay the Popup using the `visible` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\"  x=\"10\" y=\"10\" align=\"top, left\" alignTarget=\"#my-button\" visible=\"true\">\n    <div slot=\"content\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n```\n\nProgrammatically, you can use the `visible` JS property:\n\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\npopup.visible = true;\n```\n\n... or explicitly call `show()` or `hide()` methods:\n\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\nawait popup.show();\n\n// close\nawait popup.hide();\n```\n\nWhen the Popup is visible, it's possible to tell the Popup to re-render its position by using `place()`:\n\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\nawait popup.place();\n```\n\n### Size\n\nIdsPopup size can be controlled with the `max-height`, `width` and `height` properties.  These are convenience properties that set CSS-friendly size values on the IdsPopup's shadow root container:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" max-height=\"550px\" x=\"10\" y=\"10\" align=\"top, left\" alignTarget=\"#my-button\" visible=\"true\">\n    <div slot=\"content\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n```\n\n### Place\n\nThe Popup's coordinates/offsets can be set individually.  The action of using the x/y setters will change the stored position internally, but will not automatically be rendered.  Also, the position will not be rendered if the Popup is not visible.\n\nTo initially set a Popup's position, you can use the following:\n\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\npopup.x = 100;\npopup.y = 200;\nawait popup.show();\nawait popup.place();\n```\n\nIt's also possible to set both coordinate values, make the Popup visible, and render the placement in one pass using `setPosition()`:\n\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\npopup.setPosition(100, 200, true, true);\n```\n\n### Position Styles\n\nThere are three position styles:\n\n`fixed` - Uses simpler algorithms using `position: fixed;` and ignores container scrolling.\n`absolute` - Uses `position: fixed;` and accounts for container scrolling.\n`viewport` - This ignores the x/y offsets and positions the Popup directly in the middle of the viewport.  This is used for [Modals](../ids-modal/README.md)\n\n### Animation Styles\n\nIf the `animated` property is set, the `animation-styles` available are:\n\n- `fade`: animates in/out using a simple fade transition.\n- `scale-in`: Grows in from the center, shrinks out to the center on top of a simple fade transition. This is used on [Modals](../ids-modal/README.md)\n\n### Using Arrows\n\nSome Popup styles need to \"point\" at their triggering element for context, such as [Tooltips](../ids-tooltip/README.md).  To create a Popup that uses an arrow, simply tell it which way to point:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\" x=\"10\" y=\"10\" align=\"top, left\" alignTarget=\"#my-button\" arrow=\"top\">\n  <div slot=\"content\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\nIn this configuration, if a Popup is given offset value that corresponds to the `alignEdge` is not greater than the size of the Popup, the arrow's placement will be autocorrect to try and stay in alignment with the `arrowTarget`. If the offset value is greater, the arrow will hide automatically.\n\n### Using Bleeds and Containment\n\nPopups can be configured to remain inside of a set boundary element, referred to as a Containing Element.  If defined, the Popup will not cross the boundaries the containing element.  An example of this functionality is the prevention of an [IdsPopupMenu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) from appearing to be cut off by the browser's edges.\n\nUse of a containing element could be configured in this manner:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup id=\"my-popup\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" align=\"top, left\">\n  <div slot=\"content\" style=\"width: 100px; height: 100px;\">My Popup</div>\n</ids-popup>\n\n<div id=\"my-container\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 500px;\"></div>\n```\n```js\nconst popup = document.querySelector('#my-popup');\nconst container = document.querySelector('#my-container');\npopup.containingElem = container;\n```\n\nAfter setting the `containingElem` property, setting coordinates will place the Popup in a position that accounts for not crossing the container's edges.  For example:\n\n```js\npopup.x = 500;\n```\n\nGiven this value, the Popup will attempt to set the X coordinate at 500px using the default alignment of `top, left`, which places the left-most edge of the Popup at 500px.  Placing in this position would cross the boundary of the container, so instead the Popup will be nudged back into the containing element entirely, ending up with an X placement around 400px.\n\nIt's also possible to disable the check for bleeding, if necessary:\n\n```js\npopup.bleed = false;\n```\n\nRunning this immediately after our example above will cause the Popup to actually be placed at 500px.\n\nIf we decide to remove containment by the element, we can simply set it back to it's default:\n\n```js\npopup.containingElem = document.querySelector('ids-container');\n```\n\n### Alter placement programmatically\n\nIn some cases, you may want to slightly adjust the values provided by the built-in placement methods.  The `onPlace` callback can be implemented for this purpose:\n\n```js\npopup.onPlace = (popupRect) => {\n    popupRect.x += 100;\n    popupRect.y += 50;\n    return popupRect;\n}\n```\n\nThe `popupRect` argument provides access to the editable [`DOMRect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect) object that the IdsPopup uses to place itself.  The callback returns the DOMRect with modified values.\n\n#### onXYSwitch callback\n\nWhen using `alignTarget` and offsets, occasionally it may be necessary for a 'top' or 'bottom'-aligned IdsPopup to switch axes and become aligned 'right' or 'left', for the purposes of remaining inside a container area.  After this occurs, an `onXYSwitch` callback is fired with an object containing several parameters.  You can modify this object and return it to provide additional changes to the placement algorithm:\n\n- `x/y`: number values that will be used for offsets\n- `flip`: boolean true if a flip occurs at all\n- `shouldSwitchXY`: boolean true if the flip that occured also swiched the x/y axes\n- `targetEdge`: the original target edge\n- `oppositeEdge`: the edge that will be used in the case of a normal, same-axis flip\n\nFor example, this occurs when [`IdsDatePicker`]('../ids-date-picker/README.md')'s popup flips to align on the X axis, which requires more space away from its target.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\n- When making a Popup that is placed in reference to an adjacent element, it must be placed AFTER it in the DOM. Placing it BEFORE the adjacent element can cause its placement to be incorrect on its first render.\n- When using an `alignTarget`, also using the `arrow` setting and pointing it in the direction of the `alignTarget` can help contextualize the relationship between the two elements.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Place was added in v4.2.2\n- All separate placement/popup logic was replaced with Place internally (not called)\n- Place could be invoked on a custom component with `$('#my-element').place();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Place is now a custom element `<ids-popup></ids-popup>`\n- This is the new base component to be used for building Popupmenu, Tooltip, Modal, and any other component that requires placement of a absolute/fixed-position element.\n- All options/settings are now attributes: x, y, align, alignX, alignY, alignEdge, alignTarget, animated, visible.\n- Popup is now driven by its own HTMLElement rather than a being a behavior applied to any element: `<ids-popup x=\"0\" y=\"0\" align=\"top, left\">My Popup</ids-popup>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n"

        "value": "# Ids Tooltip Component\n\n## Description\n\nTooltips are a component thats used in conjunction with other components to show additional information and non critical information related to an element such as a button or field. A tooltip will displays information on either hover, tab and/or focus. In this version we have separated the tooltip from popups.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Displays additional non critical information thats not discernible from the interface/design.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Popup**: Any thing that popups up and positions use the ids-popup component\n- **Tooltip**: A message which appears when a cursor is positioned over an icon, image, hyperlink, or other element in a graphical user interface.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal tooltip used as a web component attached to a button.\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"button-1\">Example Button</ids-button>\n<ids-tooltip target=\"button-1\" placement=\"top\">Additional Information</ids-tooltip>\n```\n\nA tooltip can also be used more conveniently for text only tooltips on inputs and buttons as a mixin.\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"button-1\" tooltip=\"Additional Information\">Example Button</ids-button>\n```\n\nA tooltips content can be set in a synchronous way with the textContent attribute.\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelector('#button-1').textContent = 'New Content';\n```\n\nA tooltips content can be set in an synchronous way with the beforeShow property.\n\n```js\nconst dropdownAsync = document.querySelector('#dropdown-7');\n\ndropdownAsync.beforeShow = async function beforeShow() {\n  const url = '/data/bikes.json';\n  const res = await fetch(url);\n  const data = await res.json();\n  return data[1].manufacturerName;\n};\n```\n\nA tooltips can be manually set to visible, but it still needs an alignment target to do so.\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelector('#button-1').visible = true;\n```\n\n## Usage Guidance\n\n- Do not show critical information in a tooltip or use it for functionality, it should be strictly for supplemental information\n- Write concise tooltip text. Imagine someone on a small screen or with high zoom needing to pan around just to read the tooltip.\n- Avoid rich content. Formatting such as bold text, italics, headings, icons, etc. will not be conveyed through `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby`.\n- No interactive content. Any interactive content such as links or buttons should not be placed within a tooltip.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `delay` {string | number} Set how long after hover you should delay before showing\n- `placement` {string} Sets the tooltip placement between left, right, top, bottom\n- `target` {string | HTMLElement} Set the target element via a css selector or HTMLElement\n- `trigger` {string} Set trigger agains the target between hover, click and focus\n- `visible` {string | boolean} Set tooltip immediately to visible/invisible\n\n## Events\n\n- `beforeshow` Fires just before the tooltip is shown (veto-able if returning false from the detail event)\n- `show` Fires at the time the ids-tooltip is shown\n- `aftershow` Fires after the tooltip is fully shown\n- `hide` Fires at the time the ids-tooltip is trying  to hide\n- `afterhide` Fires after the tooltip is fully hidden\n\n## Callbacks\n\n- `onHide` Fires when the tooltip is hidden\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `popup` allows you to further style the popup container element\n- `tooltip` allows you to further style the tooltip element\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Color\n- Open\n- Closed\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the element tooltip is showing on focus then this will cause the tooltip to appear.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Tooltips do not work well in mobile or in responsive situations and should be avoided. But the tooltip will attempt to adjust to fit the page as the popup menu allows.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Tooltips were implemented in v4.0.0\n- Tooltips have all new markup and classes, and can be invoked with `$('#my-element').tooltip()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Tooltip is now a custom element `<ids-tooltip></ids-tooltip>`\n- There is no longer a \"KeepOpen\" setting, instead add a component to the page and use `visible=true`\n- Tooltip can be used as a mixin or standalone component\n- Tooltip is no longer shared with popups so all options related to that are removed\n- Error Tooltips are removed/not needed at this time\n- attachToBody option is removed/not needed at this time\n- Content can now be set with `tooltipElem.textContent`\n- Instead of open and close use `tooltipElem.visible=true`\n- `aftershow` event was not needed as its the same as `show`, so this has been removed\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nFor a good article on making the tooltip accessible see [Tooltips WCAG 2.1](https://sarahmhigley.com/writing/tooltips-in-wcag-21/)\n\nTo make the tooltip accessible we do the following:\n\nWe use `aria-describedby` or `aria-labelledby` to associate the UI control with the tooltip. Do not put essential information in tooltips.\n\nThe following general rules apply:\n\n- Do not add interactive content (buttons/links ect) in a hyperlink\n- Only interactive elements should trigger tooltips. While disabled tooltips do work on hover they do not work on focus so are not accessible and should be avoided.- Tooltip text is purely supplemental, and should not override the existing accessible name for a control.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTooltips should be localized in the current language. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

        "value": "# Ids Loading Indicator Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe `<ids-loading-indicator>` component is used to notify the user that the system is processing a request, and that they must wait for that request to be processed before continuing with the current task. There are different indicators and UI styles for different scenarios. In previous versions this has been called Loading Indicator or Busy Indicator.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Loading indicators tell users about wait times for current processes. Examples can include, searching through a page and submitting a form or a page loading. These indicators communicate the status to the user.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Determinate**: Used when there is a defined loading time. These indicators display percentages that help approximate the wait time.\n- **Indeterminate**: Used when there is an undefined loading time. These indicators are for unspecified wait times, and do not include a percentage.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA page loader can be added to a page by adding an ids-loading-indicator to the page and running the scripts. It will not appear until the web component is in a `connnected` state.\n\nA circular and indeterminate indicator will be the default behavior of an `ids-loading-indicator` without attributes passed:\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\nAdding a `linear` flag sets the indicator to be a linear indicator:\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator linear></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\n\nSetting any type of indicator's `progress` attribute will cause the indicator to become\ndeterminate and then represent the percentage given by the the attribute. In this example,\nthe progress is at 20% which would mean 20% of the linear indicator will be filled in/marked as\ncomplete.\n\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator linear progress=\"20\"></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\n\nAdding the `percentage-visible` flag attribute will cause text to show up on an indicator:\n\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator linear progress=\"20\" percentage-visible></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\n\nAdding a `sticky` attribute will set the indicator to a sticky indicator, which will affix\nthe indicator to the top of the current component.\n\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator sticky></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\n\nIn the following example, the indicator is determinate, with 10% completion and\naffixed to the top of view it is currently in:\n```html\n<ids-loading-indicator progress=\"10\" sticky></ids-loading-indicator>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `progress` *{number | undefined}* Represents the percentage completed for the indicator; if not specified, the indicator is set into indeterminate mode (e.g. no specific progress with an animation)\n- `sticky` *{boolean}* Flags the indicator as an sticky indicator type; causes\nthe indicator to stick to the top of the innermost parent IdsElement and span it horizontally. If set, will flag this indicator as a linear or circular indicator.\n- `linear` *{boolean}* value Flags the indicator as a linear indicator type; causes the indicator to span its parent component horizontally and become a horizontal/linear bar. If set, removes other current flag types that may be set.\n- `percentage-visible` *{boolean}* Denotes that the percentage text should be visible (not applicable to `sticky` loading indicators).\n\n## Themeable Parts\n- `container` - the loader (svg) container element\n- `progress` - the percentage complete or active part of the indeterminate area\n- `overall` - the overall area which would span what the indicator would at 100% and always on the indicator.\n- `percentage-text` the percentage text shown (when `percentage-visible` flag is set)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nNo keyboard shortcuts available -- the loading indicator is only meant to be a visual indicator to the user and not interactive.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- if using a `sticky` indicator, the indicator will span 100% of the nearest `relative` positioned div.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.1 Text Alternatives - Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nAny Labels should be localized in the current language. The animation should flip in RTL mode (TBD)\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Has all new markup and styles.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Busy Indicator has been renamed to `ids-loading-indicator`.\n- It has all new markup and classes for web components.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-loading-indicator></ids-loading-indicator>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- Can change the type of indicator from Circular to Linear by applying a `linear` attribute flag, or make it a sticky/bar indicator that sticks to the top of a component via the `sticky` flag.\n- Can make the indicator determinate by providing a `progress` attribute with a number representing the percentage from 0-100 that the indicator is representing a process completed so far.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Icon Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe design system provides a list of standard icons which can be used in your applications. The list of icons is a result of a studying common iconography and consolidating that with standardized icons (for example, a floppy disk to represent a \"save\" function). The icons in the list should be familiar to users.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.\n- Use too many icons and they'll become nothing more than decoration. Their use for navigation on a webpage can often cause dilution.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Icon**: An icon is a symbol. In this design case this is literal, for example  the little trashcan to indicate delete.\n- **Svg**: Stands for eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector graphic format for the Web and other environments\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nFor a normal sized icon just specific the icon name and the web component will display the appropriate icon.\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nIcons come in 6 sizes depending where it is used.\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"xxl\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"xl\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"large\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"small\"></ids-icon>\n<!-- Used only for extreme edge cases -->\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" size=\"xsmall\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nIn addition to the default sizes the icon also supports custom height, width and viewbox properties\nfor specialized cases\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" custom-height=\"80\" custom-width=\"70\" custom-viewbox=\"0 0 50 50\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nThe most common implementation of custom sizing is for empty-message icons, which are available through ids-icon\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"empty-generic\" custom-height=\"80\" custom-width=\"80\" custom-viewbox=\"0 0 80 80\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nIcons also have offer notification badge options in 4 possible positions\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-right\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"bottom-left\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"bottom-right\"></ids-icon>\n```\nThese badges can also be displayed in 5 possible colors\n\n```html\n\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\" badge-color=\"base\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\" badge-color=\"info\"></ids-icon>\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\"></ids-icon badge-color=\"warning\">\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\"></ids-icon badge-color=\"success\">\n<ids-icon icon=\"notes\" badge-position=\"top-left\" badge-color=\"error\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nAdd a custom icons by importing a custom icon file in the same format we use. The format of the json file is something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"my-icon1\": \"<path d=\\\"m7 16.81-1.57-1 .49-9L.83 3.37s-.51-1.51 1-1.56c1 .63 5.09 3.33 5.09 3.33l7.8-4.33 1.62 1-5.87 5.64 3.36 2.14 2.11-.9 1.31.85-.44.72-1.56 1-.39.63-.19 1.82-.45.73-1.31-.86-.07-2.36L9.45 9.1Z\\\"></path>\",\n  \"my-icon2\": \"<path d=\\\"m17.54 12.23-1.42 1H3.1l-2-2.6h16.42ZM3.32 8.85h2.74V7H3.32Zm4.78 0h2.74V7H8.1Zm8.56 1.62V5.19h-3.4v5.21\\\"></path>\"\n}\n```\n\nWe recommend you use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to optimize your SVG before adding them to IdsIcon. In particular inline colors and transforms can causes issues rendering the icons in buttons and other places.\n\nTo import the file use the IdsIcon static api. The file only needs to be imported once because this is static then it can be used everywhere on the page or in your framework if you do it in the right place like app startup.\n\n```js\nimport customIconJSON from './custom-icon-data.json';\n\n// May need to fetch the file with ajax...\nIdsIcon.customIconData = customIconData; // JSON String\n```\n\nOne the files are imported they can be used like a normal ids-icon\n\n```html\n<ids-icon icon=\"my-icon1\" size=\"large\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Color\n- Size\n- Alert\n- Badge-Position\n- Badge-Color\n- Height\n- Viewbox\n- Width\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nAn icon is not on its own keyboard focusable and has no keyboard interaction.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows within its parent/placement and is usually centered vertically.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Icons have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The Icon component has been changed to a web component\n- You no longer need the huge block of svg in the page.\n- The icon and size are set via properties/attributes\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-icon></ids-icon>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now display notification badge (combines this feature)\n- Can now be used to display empty-message options\n- The logos have been removed/deprecated.\n- The pseudo elements have been removed/deprecated.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

        "value": "# Ids Text Component\n\n## Description\n\nThis component styles arbitrary text elements using the design guidelines.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you need static text on a page\n- When you need disabled appearing text in a page\n- When you need text to display status state in a page\n\n## Typography\n\nTypography is used to present content in a variety of styles and size, and is essential for establishing information hierarchies, ensuring readability, and creating consistency within the content of Infor products. Typography works in tandem with icons, colors, and user patterns to create a clear landscape of what is possible in any given application.\n\n### Typography Usage\n\nTypography in our design system is presented as a series of variants which can be mixed and matched to create different font styles for different copy on your product. Text sizes range from 10 to 72, with thick and thin weights. Infor Design System uses the Source Sans Pro font, which is a friendly and approachable sans serif that brings a human touch to our enterprise software.\n\nEach typographical style contains two size values. The first denotes the size of the type, while the second denotes the corresponding line height, which is shown as 125% of the type size.\n\nSee “Variations” for more detail about our typography and use cases.\n\n### Display Text - Brand use only\n\nRanging from 40 to 72 in size, these are meant for display in presentations and marketing materials. They are not used in applications or apps.\n\n### Heading Text\n\nRanging from 20 to 32 in size, heading text can have a weight of 400 or 600. These are meant for title text in applications, and might be seen on a masthead, application header, or widget title. We recommend that these sizes only be used as titles, rather than as paragraph or body text.\n\n### Body text\n\nRanging from 14 to 16 in size, body text can have a weight of 400 or 600. These are meant for display in applications and apps. Our most used text size is 16, which works well for body text in cards, tabs, modals and many other components. Captions or small text are 14.\n\n### Body Text (All Caps)\n\nRanging from 10 to 12 in size, small text can have a weight of 300 or 600. Due to its small size, this body text contains all capital letters to improve readability and fit accessibility standards. While these sizes can be used for captions, we recommend using them sparingly due to their reduced visibility.\n\n### Quick Reference\n\n|Name|Size (px)|Weight|Line Height|Capitalization|\n|----|---------|------|-----------|--------------|\nDisplay 01|72|300|91|Normal\nDisplay 02|60|300|75|Normal\nDisplay 03|48|300|60|Normal\nDisplay 04|40|300|50|Normal\nHeading 32|32|400|40|Normal\nHeading 32 Bold|32|600|40|Normal\nHeading 28|28|400|35|Normal\nHeading 28 Bold|28|600|35|Normal\nHeading 24|24|400|30|Normal\nHeading 24 Bold|24|600|30|Normal\nHeading 20|20|400|25|Normal\nHeading 20 Bold|20|600|25|Normal\nBody Text|16|400|20|Normal\nBody Text Bold|16|600|20|Normal\nBody SM|14|400|18|Normal\nBody SM Bold|14|600|18|Normal\nSmall Text 01|12|400|15|Uppercase\nSmall Text 01 Bold|12|600|15|Uppercase\nSmall 02|10|400|13|Uppercase\nSmall 02 Bold|10|600|13|Uppercase\n\n### Colors\n\nWhen using color in type, make sure to follow the guidelines below:\n\n1. Text color should have adequate contrast to its background. You can test the contrast [here](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/).\n2. Do not use alert colors unless the text corresponds to an alert.\n3. Text colors should be mapped to a style token in IDS to ensure consistency.\n\n### Common variations\n\nWhile most text will appear in Slate 08 and fall within the type styles defined above, text color may also take the following variations in certain circumstances:\n\n1. Descriptive Text\n\nThis is the most frequently-used text color and serves as the default for short phrases and longer paragraphs. The color used for descriptive text is usually Slate 10.\n\n2. Linked Text\n\nThis is an interactive link to another page in Infor software or to external webpages. Please refer to the hyperlink documentation for further details. Text is underlined and is in Azure 06.\n\n3. Muted Text\n\nThis shows disabled functions; this text cannot be edited when it shows in an input area. The color for muted or disabled text should appear in a Slate tone lighter than the descriptive text (usually 06 or lighter).\n\n4. Alert Text\n\nThis serves as notification text that tells users of changes, errors, or updates. The color for this text is Status 01 (Ruby 06).\n\n5. Strong Text\n\nThis is heavily weighted text, used to make terms or phrases stand out. This text will appear with a weight of 600. Because of its increased weight, strong text has more flexibility with its contrast to the background.\n\n### Visual Guidelines\n\nTake readability and line length into consideration when designing and working with all Infor CloudSuite applications. We suggest keeping text between 50-75 characters per line.\n\n### Typography References\n\nLearn more about this topic [here](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/web-fonts-are-critical-to-the-online-user-experience-don-t-hurt-your-reader-s-eyes).\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Text**: A a human-readable sequence of character s and the words\n- **Disabled**: Text can be disabled, this is usually done with some other element in mind. For example a disabled field label\n- **Audible**: Text that does not appear in the page but is read by users with screen readers in order to give them information.\n\n### Text alignments\n\nSets the horizontal alignment of the content inside a block element, setting can be specified in one of the following ways:\n\n- **Start**: It is same as left if direction is left-to-right and right if direction is right-to-left.\n- **End**: It is same as right if direction is left-to-right and left if direction is right-to-left.\n- **Center**: The content will be center align.\n- **Justify**: The content will be justified. Text should be spaced to line up its left and right edges to the left and right edges, except for the last line.\n\n### Text status\n\nText can be display the status state in a page. It will show bullet character along text. Text and bullet both are display in varius colors based on type of status, available options are as:\n\n- **Base**: Show the base status, normal color for bullet and text.\n- **Error**: Show the error status, error color for built and text.\n- **Info**: Show the info status, info color for built and text.\n- **Success**: Show the success status, success color for built and text.\n- **Warning**: Show the warning status, warning color for built and text.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal text element used as a web component in size 16px.\n\n```html\n<ids-text font-size=\"16\">Normal Text</ids-text>\n```\n\nA Disabled appearing text element.\n\n```html\n<ids-text disabled=\"true\">Disabled Text</ids-text>\n```\n\nUsing the data/label.\n```html\n<ids-text label=\"true\">Title</ids-text>\n<ids-text data=\"true\">Some random data</ids-text>\n```\n\nUsing the text alignments.\n```html\n<ids-text text-align=\"end\">Some text display as end align</ids-text>\n```\n\nUsing the text status.\n```html\n<ids-text status=\"error\">Error</ids-text>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `type` {boolean} Set the type of element it is usually h1-h6. Defaults to span\n- `audible` {string} Set `audible` string (screen reader only text)\n- `disabled` {boolean} Set the text to disabled in appearance\n- `fontSize` {string} Set the size of font to use (in pixels) we use design tokens for this in specific increments [10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 20 | 24 | 28 | 32 | 40 | 48 | 60 | 72 ]\n- `mode` {string} Set the theme mode\n- `version` {string} Set the theme version\n- `color` {string} If set to `unset`, the CSS color will be `'unset'` allowing you to color with surrounding content. If set to \"muted\" will apply as disabled color.\n- `color-variant` {string} can be set to \"alternate\" to display contrasting color for text via the [IdsColorVariantMixin](../../src/mixins/ids-color-variant/README.md)\n- `data` {boolean} Sets the css of the text to the according theme\n- `label` {boolean} Sets the css of the text to the according theme\n- `text-align` {string} Sets the text alignments `start`, `end`, `center`, `justify`\n- `status` {string} Sets the text status `base`, `error`, `info`, `success`, `warning`\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `text` allows you to further style the text element\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Audible\n- Size\n- Disabled\n- Color Variant (alternate)\n- Status\n- Text alignment\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nText is not keyboard focusable so has no keyboard shortcuts.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container. Possibly scrolling as needed based on parent dimensions.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions\n\n- 3.x: Did not exist\n- 4.x: Convert spans/ h1-h6 to use the web component with types\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nText should be localized in the current language. And should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

        "value": "# Ids Button Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe IDS Button component is a simple wrapper around a standard HTMLButtonElement that is styled with Infor branding, and contains some additional API that makes it easy to set text, icons, and functionality.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Create standalone buttons\n- Create multiple buttons, each with different styling to provide context for actions that are primary, secondary, and tertiary.\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Primary**: A primary action that is the definitive \"use\" of a particular feature.  For example, after doing data entry on a form, the primary action might be to \"Save\" the contents of that form to a record.\n**Secondary**: A secondary action is one that might be related to the primary action, but alternative in nature.  For example, a secondary action that might sit next to our above primary action could be \"reset\", which would remove the user-entered contents of the form and start from scratch.\n**Tertiary**: Sometimes also called \"destructive\" in IDS, a tertiary action is one that might \"undo\" or be completely separate from the primary/secondary actions, but labelled with enough importance to be displayed aside them. Building on the above examples, a tertiary action might be \"cancel\" or \"close\", which would cause the form to close, and return the user to the previous workflow.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `button` allows you to further style the internal button element\n- `icon` allows you to further style the internal icon element (used in some types of buttons)\n- `text` allows you to further style the internal icon element (used in some types of buttons)\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nStandalone primary buttons could be built this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\nAdd an icon to the button using the `icon` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\" icon=\"settings\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\nIDS Buttons can be designed to make the icon appear by itself, without any visible text.  For accessibility reasons, descriptive text explaining the button's function should always be present.  In this scenario, the text span can have an \"audible\" class added, which will visually hide the text, but keep it accessible to screen readers:\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\" icon=\"settings\">\n  <span class=\"audible\">My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n### Color Variants\n\nIf placing a button inside a container with a contrasting background color, sometimes the \"base\" styles for Ids Button appearances aren't adequate for passing contrast checks. To resolve this problem, the `color-variant` property can be used by way of the [IdsColorVariantMixin](../../mixins/ids-color-variant-mixin/README.md):\n\n```html\n<!-- Generates a default (Tertiary) Button with white text and focus/hover states --->\n<ids-button id=\"my-button-1\" color-variant=\"alternate\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n\n<!-- Generates a Primary Button with a slightly more bright Azure --->\n<ids-button id=\"my-button-2\" appearance=\"primary\" color-variant=\"alternate\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n\n<!-- Generates a Secondary Button with a slightly more bright Slate --->\n<ids-button id=\"my-button-3\" appearance=\"primary\" color-variant=\"alternate\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n\n<!-- Generates a button to use with toolbar formatter type --->\n<ids-button id=\"my-button-4\" color-variant=\"alternate-formatter\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\nStandard button states include:\n\n- Normal\n- Hover\n- Focus\n- Active (pressed)\n- Disabled\n- Color Variant - alternate colors for each button appearance are available via the [IdsColorVariantMixin](../../src/mixins/ids-color-variant/README.md)\n\nIDS button appearances include:\n\n- `default` (not displayed as a \"appearance\" attribute when set)\n- `primary`\n- `primary-destructive`\n- `secondary`\n- `tertiary`\n- `tertiary-destructive`\n\n### Alignment\n\nBy default, alignment of text/icons within an IDS Button will occur based on the DOM order of those elements.  However, if the `icon-align` attribute is specified, the alignment order of the inner elements can be forced.\n\nThe example below will result in the icon appearing after the text, even though the DOM order is the opposite:\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\" icon=\"settings\" icon-align=\"end\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\nThe attribute has the following effects:\n\n| prop value | LTR (default) Icon Location | RTL Icon Location |\n| :--------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------- |\n| undefined  | n/a | n/a |\n| 'start'    | icon to the left of text | icon to the right of text |\n| 'end'      | icon to the right of text | icon to the left of text |\n\n### Type\n\nIdsButton's type attribute simply passes through to the Shadow Root's HTMLButtonElement and defines its usage.  For example, this is how you would define a form's `submit` button:\n\n```html\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" type=\"submit\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `appearance` {string} The visual style defining the purpose of the button\n- `colorVariant` {'alternate' | 'alternate-formatter'} Set the variants theme styles\n- `cssClass` {Array<string> | string | null} Contains space-delimited CSS classes (or an array of CSS classes) that will be passed to the Shadow Root button\n- `disabled` {boolean} Sets the internal Button element's `disabled` property to enable/disable the button\n- `icon` {string | null} A string representing an icon to display inside the button.  This string is passed to a slotted [IdsIcon](../ids-icon/README.md) element's `icon` setting to set the desired icon type.\n- `iconAlign` {string} Defines which side to align the Button's icon against, can be 'start' or 'end'\n- `tabIndex` {string | number} Sets the internal Button element's `tabIndex` property for controlling focus\n- `text` {string} API-level method of setting a button's text content. This will become the content of the slotted text node when set\n- `type` {string} Passes a 'type' attribute for a standard HTMLButtonElement into the IdsButton's ShadowRoot-contained button element\n- `tooltip` {string} Sets up a string based tooltip\n- `square` {boolean} whether the corners of the button as an icon-button are angled/90°\n- `width` {string} Sets width of button. Accepts percent, pixels, rem, etc.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Button doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLButtonElement:\n\n- <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys execute the action for that button. If the button activation closes the containing entity or launches another entity, then focus moves to the newly-opened entity. If the button activation does not close or dismiss the containing entity, then focus remains on the button. An example might be an \"Apply\" or \"Recalculate\" button.\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Tab<kbd> causes focus to move away from the button forward or backward one element/set respectively.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Buttons can optionally be 100% width of their parent container on mobile breakpoints\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- All buttons, including icon-only buttons, should have some kind of text description inside the button for explaining its action to a visually-impaired user. This text can be hidden visually by way of using an `audible` CSS class on the text content.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nBe conscious of the layout of content within your buttons when they are present in RTL situations.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Change class `inforFormButton` default to `btn-primary`\n- Change class `inforFormButton` to `btn-secondary\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\nThe IDS Button component is now a WebComponent.  Instead of using classes to define a button's purpose or visual style, it's now done directly with an \"appearance\" attribute:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x button example -->\n<button class=\"btn-primary\" id=\"my-button\">\n  <svg class=\"icon\" role=\"presentation\">\n    <use href=\"#settings\"></use>\n  </svg>\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- this is the same button using the WebComponent -->\n<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\" icon=\"settings\">\n  <span>My Button</span>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-button id=\"my-button\" appearance=\"primary\"></ids-button>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n- Some button properties are now attributes - \"appearance\", \"text\", \"icon\", \"disabled\", etc.\n- Some components now extend IdsButton, such as [IdsToggleButton](../ids-toggle-button/README.md) and [IdsMenuButton](../ids-menu-button/README.md)...\n"

In this case, a click event is bound to the defined trigger element that will activate the modal.\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\">\n    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>\n</ids-modal>\n\n<ids-button id=\"trigger-button\" appearance=\"secondary\">\n    <span>Trigger Modal</span>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"launch\"></ids-icon>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n```js\nconst modal = document.querySelector('#my-modal');\nconst btn = document.querySelector('#trigger-button');\nmodal.target = btn;\n\nbtn.click();\n// ...Modal is triggered by its target element\n```\n### Adding a Message Title and Buttons\n\nIt's possible to append a Message Title to add more context, and Buttons to create multiple actions that can be triggered from the Modal.  To do so, take advantage of the Modal's slots:\n\n- The \"title\" slot, which can be populated by an [IdsText](../ids-text/README.md) or other text element, and will be located at the top of the Modal.\n- The \"buttons\" slot, which can be filled with one or multiple [IdsModalButtons](../ids-modal-button/README.md), and will be located at the bottom of the Modal.\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">This is the Title</ids-text>\n    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"ok\" appearance=\"primary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"cancel\" appearance=\"secondary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-modal>\n```\n\n### Displaying in fullsize mode\n\nIdsModal can alter its display mode to take up 100% of the browser viewport's width/height by using the `fullsize` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\" fullsize=\"lg\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">Fullsize Modal</ids-text>\n    <p>This modal will transform when below the `lg` breakpoint</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"ok\" appearance=\"primary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"cancel\" appearance=\"secondary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-modal>\n```\n\nThe fullsize attribute can be defined with an IDS Breakpoint, as defined in the [IdsBreakpointMixin](../../mixins/ids-breakpoint-mixin/README.md).  Alternatively, this setting can be changed to `null` or `''` resulting in no fullscreen mode, or `'always'` which forces the fullscreen mode to be displayed indefinitely.\n\nBy default, the fullsize setting on all modals is set to Small (sm) and will break when the viewport width is below 600px.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Modal was added in v4.0.0\n- Replace `.inforDialog()` with `.modal()`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Modal is now a custom element `<ids-modal></ids-modal>`\n- Modal content is now user-defined by slot\n- Triggering element for the modal is now configurable with the `target` prop\n- Events are now just plain JS events\n"

In this case, a click event is bound to the defined trigger element that will activate the modal.\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\">\n    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>\n</ids-modal>\n\n<ids-button id=\"trigger-button\" appearance=\"secondary\">\n    <span>Trigger Modal</span>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"launch\"></ids-icon>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n```js\nconst modal = document.querySelector('#my-modal');\nconst btn = document.querySelector('#trigger-button');\nmodal.target = btn;\n\nbtn.click();\n// ...Modal is triggered by its target element\n```\n### Adding a Message Title and Buttons\n\nIt's possible to append a Message Title to add more context, and Buttons to create multiple actions that can be triggered from the Modal.  To do so, take advantage of the Modal's slots:\n\n- The \"title\" slot, which can be populated by an [IdsText](../ids-text/README.md) or other text element, and will be located at the top of the Modal.\n- The \"buttons\" slot, which can be filled with one or multiple [IdsModalButtons](../ids-modal-button/README.md), and will be located at the bottom of the Modal.\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">This is the Title</ids-text>\n    <p>This is a simple Modal component</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"ok\" appearance=\"primary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"cancel\" appearance=\"secondary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-modal>\n```\n\n### Displaying in fullsize mode\n\nIdsModal can alter its display mode to take up 100% of the browser viewport's width/height by using the `fullsize` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-modal id=\"my-modal\" fullsize=\"lg\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">Fullsize Modal</ids-text>\n    <p>This modal will transform when below the `lg` breakpoint</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"ok\" appearance=\"primary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"cancel\" appearance=\"secondary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-modal>\n```\n\nThe fullsize attribute can be defined with an IDS Breakpoint, as defined in the [IdsBreakpointMixin](../../mixins/ids-breakpoint-mixin/README.md).  Alternatively, this setting can be changed to `null` or `''` resulting in no fullscreen mode, or `'always'` which forces the fullscreen mode to be displayed indefinitely.\n\nBy default, the fullsize setting on all modals is set to Small (sm) and will break when the viewport width is below 600px.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Modal was added in v4.0.0\n- Replace `.inforDialog()` with `.modal()`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Modal is now a custom element `<ids-modal></ids-modal>`\n- Modal content is now user-defined by slot\n- Triggering element for the modal is now configurable with the `target` prop\n- Events are now just plain JS events\n"

Typically a hyperlink will open a file file or document or be used to navigate to a new location.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you need static text on a page\n- When you need disabled appearing text in a page\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Link/Hyperlink**: An interactive link to another page within Infor software to external destinations.\n- **Disabled**: A link can be disabled if its not actionable at the moment.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal hyperlink element used as a web component that opens a url in a new window.\n\n```html\n<ids-hyperlink href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Normal Link</ids-hyperlink>\n```\n\nA Disabled appearing hyperlink element.\n\n```html\n  <ids-hyperlink href=\"http://www.example.com\" disabled=\"true\" target=\"_blank\">Disabled Link</ids-hyperlink>\n```\n\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `disabled` {boolean} Set the link to disabled\n- `href` {string} Set the links href to a url or file\n- `target` {string} Set the links target attribute. Valid values are '_blank' | '_self' | '_parent' | '_top' | frame name.\n- `allow-empty-href` {boolean} Allows underline and styling of the link when href attribute is empty. Defaults to true.\n- `mode` {string} Set the theme mode\n- `version` {string} Set the theme version\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `link` allows you to further style the link element\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Disabled\n- Visited\n- Hover\n- Active\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the link is enabled this will focus or unfocus the link.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: If this will follow the link url or action.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container. Possibly scrolling as needed based on parent dimensions.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Used a css class on `<a>` tags\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The Hyperlink component has been changed to a web component\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-hyperlink></ids-hyperlink>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- The directional links have been removed/deprecated.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLink text should be localized in the current language. And should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

This is common in accordions used for navigation purposes, such as the ones applied to the [App Menu](../ids-app-menu/README.md).\n\nIn the example below, the \"My Benefits\", \"Dependents and Beneficiaries\", \"Life Events\", and \"Benefits Information\" panels are nested beneath the \"Benefits\" panel, which is nested beneath the \"Employee\" panel.\n\n```html\n<ids-accordion id=\"app-menu-style\">\n    <ids-accordion-panel id=\"employee\">\n        <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n            <ids-icon icon=\"user\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n            <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Employee</ids-text>\n        </ids-accordion-header>\n        <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"benefits\">\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" expander-type=\"plus-minus\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Benefits</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"my-benefits\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">My Benefits</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"dependents-beneficiaries\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Dependents and Beneficiaries</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"life-events\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Life Events</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"benefits-information\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Benefits Information</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n    </ids-accordion-panel>\n</ids-accordion>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsAccordion\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsKeyboardMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n- IdsAccordionHeader\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n- IdsAccordionPanel\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsKeyboardMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\nWhen used as an attribute the settings are kebab case, when used in the JS they are camel case.\n\n- `headers` {Array<IdsAccordionHeader>} Reference to all inner Accordion Headers.\n- `panels` {Array<IdsAccordionPanel>} Reference to all inner Accordion Panels.\n- `focused` {HTMLElement} Reference to the currently-focused element within the accordion, if applicable.\n- `allowOnePane` {boolean} Sets Accordion to allow only one inner Accordion Panel to be expanded at a time.\n\n## Events\n\n- `selected` Fire at the time the ids-accordion-panel element is selected, used for App-Menu,\nDetail contains the element `elem`\n- `expanded` Fires at the time the ids-accordion-panel is expanded. Detail contains the element `elem`\n- `collapsed` Fires at the time the ids-accordion-panel is collapsed. Detail contains the element `elem`\n\n## Methods\n\n- IdsAccordion\n  - `navigate` Navigate to the next/prev panel\n- IdsAccordionPanel\n  - `collapsePane` Collapse pane\n  - `expandPane` Expand pane\n  - `select` Select header and focus it\n  - `focus` Set focus on header\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `accordion` Accordion root element\n\n## States and Variations\n\nThe Accordion's headers support the following states:\n\n- Normal/Default: This is the default of an accordion.\n- Hover: Roll over an interactive element inside the accordion\n- Disabled: Disabled elements can be inside an accordion. These cards cannot be clicked, hovered or focused.\n- Focus: For accessibility. To give a user guidance when using a screen reader.\n- Active/Selected: After the pressed/clicked state, users are taken to the active state. This includes expanding or closing an accordion.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Shift+Tab**: Works the same as Tab, but in the opposite direction. When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of down/right will move focus to the next logical accordion Header or Tab page. When focus reaches the last header/tab page, further key presses will have optionally wrap to the first header\n- **Up Arrow or Left Arrow**: When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of up/left will move focus to the previous logical accordion header or tab page. When focus reaches the first header/tab page, further key presses will optionally wrap to the last header.  This keystroke is also aware of how to traverse different levels of nested accordion panels.\n- **Down Arrow or Right Arrow**: When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of down/right will move focus to the next logical accordion header or tab page. When focus reaches the last header/tab page, further key presses will optionally wrap to the first header.  This keystroke is also aware of how to traverse different levels of nested accordion panels.\n- **Enter or Space**: When focus is on an accordion header, this keystroke toggles the expansion of the corresponding panel. If collapsed, the panel is expanded, and its aria-expanded state is set to true. If expanded, the panel is collapsed and its aria-expanded state is set to false.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe IDS Accordion component has a `role=\"region\"` and a unique `title` is generated for each instance.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Replace `.inforAboutDialog()` with `.about()` and notice that many of the names of the settings (e.g. productName to appName) to have changed so must be updated to the new settings.\n- The initial markup is changed considerably from the previous version. Sync the markup using the markup above\n- Initialize the accordion plugin with .accordion() as opposed to `.inforAccordion()` or by using the page initializer\nonExpanded and onCollapsed option are done with events (expanded and collapsed)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Accordion now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- Now called IdsAccordion with a namespace\n- The \"Panels\" examples are removed and deprecated as they should rarely be used.\n- The deprecated `displayChevron` setting is removed.\n- The `enableTooltips` removed and deprecated as not added as it seems no longer relevant.\n- The `expanderDisplay` option was removed and deprecated as it was used only by IdsAppMenu and is no longer needed.\n- The `rerouteOnLinkClick` option was removed and deprecated as is no longer needed as there are no links in the markup now.\n- The `source` option was removed and deprecated as it was used only by IdsAppMenu and is no longer needed in accordion but will be added to IdsAppMenu.\n- The `destroy` method has been removed since everything is now cleaned up when removing the DOM element\n"

This is common in accordions used for navigation purposes, such as the ones applied to the [App Menu](../ids-app-menu/README.md).\n\nIn the example below, the \"My Benefits\", \"Dependents and Beneficiaries\", \"Life Events\", and \"Benefits Information\" panels are nested beneath the \"Benefits\" panel, which is nested beneath the \"Employee\" panel.\n\n```html\n<ids-accordion id=\"app-menu-style\">\n    <ids-accordion-panel id=\"employee\">\n        <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n            <ids-icon icon=\"user\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n            <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Employee</ids-text>\n        </ids-accordion-header>\n        <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"benefits\">\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" expander-type=\"plus-minus\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Benefits</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"my-benefits\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">My Benefits</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"dependents-beneficiaries\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Dependents and Beneficiaries</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"life-events\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Life Events</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-panel slot=\"content\" id=\"benefits-information\">\n                <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n                    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">Benefits Information</ids-text>\n                </ids-accordion-header>\n            </ids-accordion-panel>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n    </ids-accordion-panel>\n</ids-accordion>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsAccordion\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsKeyboardMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n- IdsAccordionHeader\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n- IdsAccordionPanel\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsKeyboardMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\nWhen used as an attribute the settings are kebab case, when used in the JS they are camel case.\n\n- `headers` {Array<IdsAccordionHeader>} Reference to all inner Accordion Headers.\n- `panels` {Array<IdsAccordionPanel>} Reference to all inner Accordion Panels.\n- `focused` {HTMLElement} Reference to the currently-focused element within the accordion, if applicable.\n- `allowOnePane` {boolean} Sets Accordion to allow only one inner Accordion Panel to be expanded at a time.\n\n## Events\n\n- `selected` Fire at the time the ids-accordion-panel element is selected, used for App-Menu,\nDetail contains the element `elem`\n- `expanded` Fires at the time the ids-accordion-panel is expanded. Detail contains the element `elem`\n- `collapsed` Fires at the time the ids-accordion-panel is collapsed.

These cards cannot be clicked, hovered or focused.\n- Focus: For accessibility. To give a user guidance when using a screen reader.\n- Active/Selected: After the pressed/clicked state, users are taken to the active state. This includes expanding or closing an accordion.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Shift+Tab**: Works the same as Tab, but in the opposite direction. When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of down/right will move focus to the next logical accordion Header or Tab page. When focus reaches the last header/tab page, further key presses will have optionally wrap to the first header\n- **Up Arrow or Left Arrow**: When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of up/left will move focus to the previous logical accordion header or tab page. When focus reaches the first header/tab page, further key presses will optionally wrap to the last header.  This keystroke is also aware of how to traverse different levels of nested accordion panels.\n- **Down Arrow or Right Arrow**: When focus is on the tab or accordion header, a press of down/right will move focus to the next logical accordion header or tab page. When focus reaches the last header/tab page, further key presses will optionally wrap to the first header.  This keystroke is also aware of how to traverse different levels of nested accordion panels.\n- **Enter or Space**: When focus is on an accordion header, this keystroke toggles the expansion of the corresponding panel. If collapsed, the panel is expanded, and its aria-expanded state is set to true. If expanded, the panel is collapsed and its aria-expanded state is set to false.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe IDS Accordion component has a `role=\"region\"` and a unique `title` is generated for each instance.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Replace `.inforAboutDialog()` with `.about()` and notice that many of the names of the settings (e.g. productName to appName) to have changed so must be updated to the new settings.\n- The initial markup is changed considerably from the previous version. Sync the markup using the markup above\n- Initialize the accordion plugin with .accordion() as opposed to `.inforAccordion()` or by using the page initializer\nonExpanded and onCollapsed option are done with events (expanded and collapsed)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Accordion now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- Now called IdsAccordion with a namespace\n- The \"Panels\" examples are removed and deprecated as they should rarely be used.\n- The deprecated `displayChevron` setting is removed.\n- The `enableTooltips` removed and deprecated as not added as it seems no longer relevant.\n- The `expanderDisplay` option was removed and deprecated as it was used only by IdsAppMenu and is no longer needed.\n- The `rerouteOnLinkClick` option was removed and deprecated as is no longer needed as there are no links in the markup now.\n- The `source` option was removed and deprecated as it was used only by IdsAppMenu and is no longer needed in accordion but will be added to IdsAppMenu.\n- The `destroy` method has been removed since everything is now cleaned up when removing the DOM element\n"

A basic accordion will consist of a `ids-accordion-header` which shows a title or summary of the `ids-accordion-panel` and acts as a control for expanding and collapsing. Note: Standalone Css is not available for this component.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Can be used to conserve space, by hiding information until needed. Accordions can be commonly seen on mobile sites and applications. It can help tell the user what the page is about and allows the user to select and see what is needed.\n- Can be used for navigation.  The accordion is the main interactive element inside of the [App Menu](../ids-app-menu/README.md)\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **ids-accordion** Parent container for all accordions\n- **ids-accordion-panel** First child of and accordion. Contains the header and content area. Contains 2 slots, the `header` and the `pane`.\n- **ids-accordion-header** Typically used in the header slot, contains the title and acts as the control for expanding and collapsing.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nStandard accordion, most commonly used:\n\n```html\n<ids-accordion>\n    <ids-accordion-panel>\n        <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\">\n            <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Warehouse Location</ids-text>\n        </ids-accordion-header>\n        <ids-text slot=\"content\">\n            Remix, optimize, \"B2B, iterate?\" Best-of-breed efficient beta-test; social cutting-edge: rich magnetic tagclouds\n            front-end infomediaries viral authentic incentivize sexy extensible functionalities incentivize.

In this example selecting `Two` will mark it checked and unchecked\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"simple-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-menu-item>One</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item toggleable>Two</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Three</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nA more complicated menu can be formed using combinations of  `ids-menu` with a `ids-menu-group` and nested `ids-menu-item` components.\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"complex-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"long-no-icons\">Very long, indescribable action with no icons</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"url\" disabled=\"true\" value=\"big-with-icons\">\n      Another big menu item, but with icons!\n    </ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n  <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n  <ids-menu-header id=\"additional-actions-header\">Additional Actions</ids-menu-header>\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"more-settings\" aria-describedby=\"additional-actions-header\">\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"more-actions\">\n      More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"user\" value=\"even-more-actions\">\n        Even More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item id=\"no-select\" value=\"no-select\">This one can't be selected (Check the console)</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-group id=\"other-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"more\" value=\"other-items\">Other Items</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n### Selection Event Handling\n\nWhen an `<ids-menu-item>` element is selected from a menu, it has the potential to fire up to two different events.  The events fired depend on how the menu is configured.  Consider this menu:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nIn this example, when any of the menu's items are chosen by click or by keyboard, no selection events are fired.  This is because there is no `select` attribute determining single or multiple selection.  The menu item chosen will not change the menu's selection state, and will simply fire a `pick` event.\n\nThis next example will cause a both a `selected` event and a `pick` event to fire whenever an item is chosen.  No `deselected` events will fire in this case:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\" select=\"single\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nYou can also have `toggleable` menu items where the menu item check can be turned on and off. For example\n\n```html\n<ids-menu>\n  <ids-menu-group select=\"single\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" toggable value=\"mail\">Keep Active</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nThis next example will cause a either a `selected` OR `deselected` event, as well as a `pick` event, to fire whenever an item is chosen.  When an item is chosen, its selection state is changed, and the event fired corresponds to its new value:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\" select=\"multiple\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\n### Shortcut keys\n\nIdsMenuItem elements can have a `shortcut-keys` attribute defined, which will pass text representing a keyboard shortcut to be displayed into the white space opposite the regular text:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-item id=\"action-create\" icon=\"folder\" shortcut-keys=\"⌘+R\">Create New Folder</ids-menu-item>\n```\n\n```js\nconst menuItem = document.querySelector('ids-menu-item');\nmenuItem.setAttribute('shortcut-keys', '⌘+R');\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy Menu Group\n\n- IdsMenuGroup\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n\n## Class Hierarchy Menu Header\n\n- IdsMenuHeader\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n\n## Class Hierarchy Menu Item\n\n- IdsMenuItem\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- This component is relatively backwards compatible except inforContextMenu should be replaced with popupmenu in the API call and class name\n- Remove class divider as it is deprecated\n- Checkbox construct is simplified\n- Group replaced with heading\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The menu component has been changed to a web component and renamed to `ids-menu`.\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-menu></ids-menu>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example (i.e. menu click events)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n"

        "value": "# Ids Toolbar Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Ids Toolbar is used for building highly-configurable Toolbars for sections of your application.  It displays [buttons](../ids-button/README.md), hyperlinks, and other components in different align-able sections, along with contextual information about a workflow or process.\n\nThe Ids Toolbar can also be responsive, intelligently hiding buttons that can't be shown on-screen, and displaying them in an overflow menu.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Provides contextual information for a workflow or process displayed on screen\n- Provides access to contextual actions for said workflow/process\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Section** Toolbars are divided into sections.  Each of these sections has their own alignment style and \"type\" that determines how it fits within the Toolbar.\n**Item** Toolbar items are the actionable elements within a toolbar.  In general they correspond standard HTML Elements or other IDS Components, such as buttons, hyperlinks, checkboxes, etc.\n**More Actions** This optional element can be applied to Toolbars that contain a significant number of actions that cannot all be displayed on screen at one time.  This element contains a menu button that will display any \"spilled-over\" contents from the Toolbar when active, once those actions are no longer visible on the Toolbar.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n### Toolbar\n\n- `disabled` makes the entire toolbar enabled/disabled\n- `focused` describes the currently-focused Toolbar item\n- `items` provides access to all Toolbar items in all sections\n- `sections` provides access to all the Toolbar's sections\n- `separators` provides access to all the Toolbar's separators\n- `tabbable` if true, makes it possible to navigate all Toolbar items by using the Tab/Shift+Tab keys by setting all items to a 0-or-more tabIndex property.  By default (false), only one Toolbar item at a time can have a 0-or-more tabIndex.\n\n### Toolbar Section\n\n- `align` - Determines the alignment of the items within this section.  Defaults to `start`, which is the left side of the Toolbar in a standard Left-to-Right toolbar setup.  Can also be `center` and `end` (right).\n- `favor` - Determines if this section should not shrink/collapse when the size of the entire Toolbar shrinks. This causes the other Toolbar sections to become smaller first.\n- `items` - provides access to all Toolbar items in this section.\n- `type` - Sets a pre-defined \"type\" on the toolbar section. This defaults to `static` but can also be set to `title`, `buttonset`, and `search` to mimic those specific sections. To create a custom section that fills available space, `fluid` is also an available type. Type `button` is for a single button in the section to maintain button's focus state.\n\n### Toolbar More Actions\n\n- `button` provides access to the internal [Menu Button component](../ids-menu-button/README.md)\n- `menu` provides access to the internal [Popup Menu component](../ids-popup-menu/README.md)\n- `overflow` if true, menu items that cannot be displayed in the main Toolbar area due to lack of space will be \"mirrored\" and generated as menu items in a special group inside this menu.  Clicking the mirrored menu items will cause the original Toolbar action to be fired.  When a [Menu Button](../ids-menu-button/README.md) component is mirrored, its attached menu is also mirrored as a submenu on its generated menu item.\n- `type` this component is a standalone toolbar section that always reports `more` for its type.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- \"disabled\"\n- \"tabbable\"\n\nAside from the Toolbar-level disabled state, all individual Toolbar items are responsible for management of their own state.  For more information on these components' states, see their documentation pages.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nIds Toolbars are comprised of the Toolbar element, an indeterminate number of Toolbar sections, and an optional \"More Actions\" menu button element. Inside of the different toolbar sections, it's possible to place different Ids Components.  Below is a basic example of what an entire Ids Toolbar may look like:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n        <ids-text type=\"h3\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Text</span>\n        </ids-button>\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n            <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n            <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n        <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>More Options\n            <ids-popup-menu>\n                <ids-menu-group>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n                </ids-menu-group>\n            </ids-popup-menu>\n            </ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    </ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n</ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### Sections\n\nToolbar sections can be configured with different \"types\" that can determine their look/feel/function.  By default, the sections do not fill available space and contain no padding.  These are `static` toolbar sections:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-button icon=\"menu\" role=\"button\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Application Menu Trigger</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nFor compatibility with 4.x components Toolbars, the IDS Toolbar also supports `title` and `buttonset` section types that act similarly.  The styling is less rigid than in previous iterations, so to make a `buttonset` section \"right\"-aligned, it's necessary to add the `align=\"end\"` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Title sections can have multiple text elements, if needed:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n\n<!-- or... -->\n\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Buttonset sections can contain an indeterminate number of components.  Generally these are [Buttons](../ids-button/README.md), but other component types such as Hyperlinks and some Pickers are accepted.  The Buttonset Section is styled with CSS to prevent the wrapping of these elements to multiple lines, instead cutting off actions that don't fit.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-3\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-4\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbars can also contain sections that are meant to be customized with CSS.  It's possible to create custom static sections with the `static` type, but if you want to make a custom section that fills available space, use the `fluid` type:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <!-- takes up as little space as possible --->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"static\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 1</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n\n    <!-- fills the rest of the toolbar space -->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"fluid\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 2</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\nThe toolbar can be set as the formatter styles:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar type=\"formatter\">\n  <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 1</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-separator vertical></ids-separator>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 2</span>\n    </ids-button>\n  </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### More Actions Button\n\nOptionally, toolbars can contain a \"More Actions\" Button, which is a [Menu Button]('../ids-menu-button/README.md) wrapped inside a special Toolbar Section.  This component's purpose is to provide ansulary actions that are related to your Toolbar's primary actions, but don't necessarily need to be readily available on a single click.  In responsive settings with many primary actions present, the Toolbar will collapse any actions that don't fit within its boundaries.  Optionally, the More Actions menu can display these collapsed actions at the top of its menu (also referred to as the \"overflow\" menu).\n\nThe Ids Toolbar More Actions component sits alongside the other toolbar sections, and contains a single slot that takes the same types of elements as a standard [Ids Popup Menu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md):\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item>More Options\n        <ids-popup-menu>\n            <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n            </ids-menu-group>\n        </ids-popup-menu>\n        </ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\nIf accompanied by a More Actions button with the `overflow` attribute set, Toolbar Actions that don't fit within their sections will be hidden in the Toolbar, but will also \"spill over\" into the More Actions menu, inside a special `IdsMenuGroup` with a `more-actions` attribute.  If a user clicks on one of the menu items that reflects a Toolbar element, the Toolbar element will also be \"clicked\".  This allows visually-hidden Toolbar actions to still remain available in responsive settings.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions overflow>\n    <!--\n        Toolbar Items will be mirrored here inside a group that looks like:\n        <ids-menu-group more-actions>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    --->\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\n### API Access\n\nAt the Toolbar level, it's possible to access all Items and Sections:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').items;\nconst sections = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').sections;\n```\n\nWithin each section, it's possible to access the section's items:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-section').items;\n```\n\nWhen dealing with a More Actions button, its inner components' APIs are exposed:\n\n```js\nconst moreActionsButtonEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').button;\nconst moreActionsMenuEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').menu;\n```\n\nAccess to the different More Actions menu items is also exposed:\n\n```js\n// These items are defined inside the `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>` element's default slot.\nconst predefinedMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').predefinedMenuItems;\n\n// These items are generated by the More Actions menu if the `overflow` attribute is set.\n// These items mirror the regular Toolbar elements.\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\n```\n\nOverflow menu items also provide a reference to their corresponding Toolbar element:\n\n```js\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\noverflowMenuItems.forEach((item) => {\n  console.info(item.overflowTarget); // <-- Points to the Toolbar button/element/etc\n});\n```\n\n### Events\n\nAll elements inside the Toolbar will fire a `selected` event when clicked.  The `selected` event from the More Actions menu's [IdsPopupMenu]('../ids-popup-menu/README.md) is converted into a Toolbar-compatible event automatically, so only one listener at the Toolbar level is needed:\n\n```js\nconst toolbarEl = document.querySelector('#my-toolbar');\ntoolbarEl.addEventListener('selected', (e) => {\n  console.info(e.detail); // Provides data about the originating element, and overflow status, if applicable\n}\n```\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Button doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLButtonElement:\n\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys selects a toolbar action and executes the action.  On menu buttons, the menu is activated/hidden, and an action is not executed until one of its menu items is selected.\n- <kbd>Left/Right Arrow</kbd> keys navigate the available toolbar items.\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Tab<kbd> keys cause navigation to occur.  When `tabbable=\"true\"`, using Tab/Shift+Tab causes navigation between Toolbar items. When `tabbable=\"false\"`, Navigation away from the toolbar will occur to the element after/before the Toolbar respectively.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Try not to provide an over-abundance of Toolbar Actions.  The Toolbar's intention is to provide contextual actions for a specific workflow. Providing too many actions can cause end-user confusion.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Toolbar was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbar();`\n- Flex Toolbar replaced/deprecated Toolbar in v4.3.0\n- Flex Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbarflex();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Flex Toolbar is now a custom element `<ids-toolbar></ids-toolbar>`\n- Toolbar Sections are now codified as components `<ids-toolbar-section>`\n- More Actions Buttons are now a codified components `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>`\n- Toolbars now implement `tabbable` to enable use of (Shift)/Tab keys for navigation\n- Toolbar Section behavior is now controlled by attributes (`favor`, `type`, etc) instead of CSS classes.\n- Not including a More Actions button in markup explicitly disables the menu from being displayed.\n- The More Actions button can be configured NOT to automatically show overflow items by omitting its `overflow` attribute.  This allows for pre-defined menu items to be displayed without items being spilled over to the overflow menu.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Menu Button Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe IDS Menu Button component is an extension of the standard [Button component](../ids-button/README.md) that is styled with Infor branding, and allows for being implicitly linked to an [IDS Popup Menu Component](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) that can be used for triggering multiple different actions.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Create menu buttons that store multiple different actions\n- Create menu buttons that allow selection of single items within groups\n- Create menu buttons that allow selection of multiple items within groups\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Dropdown Icon** Menu Buttons have a secondary icon (separate from the IDS Button \"icon\" property) that acts as the Popup Menu's Arrow Target.  This icon is normally a standard \"dropdown\" icon, but can be changed if needed.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `disabled` true if the Menu Button should become disabled.  This also makes the attached Popupmenu and all of its sub-elements disabled.\n- `dropdownIcon` sets the type of icon to be used as the dropdown icon.  If null/empty, the dropdown icon is not displayed.  Note that this is different than the standard IDS Button `icon` property, and both can exist at the same time.\n- `formatterWidth` set the width and formatter style for menu button.\n- `menu` can be defined as a CSS selector string, or if using the JS property, can be a direct reference to an IdsPopupMenu component.\n- `value` sets/gets selected menu items by providing list of menu item values\n\n## States and Variations\n\nSince the menu button combined from several IDS Components, you can refer to their documentation for information about states/variants:\n\n- [IdsButton](../ids-button/README.md) for Button-specific states\n- [IdsPopupMenu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) for Menu-specific states\n\n### Variations\n\n- [\"More Actions\" Button]() is technically a menu button, since it contains additional actions related to the current workflow hidden in a Popup Menu.  This variant displays no dropdown icon, and appears as an Icon Button.\n\n## Features (with code samples)\n\nMost menu buttons are implicitly linked to their Popup Menus using `id` attributes.  The Popup Menu also needs to be told which `target` element to use:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-button id=\"my-button\" menu=\"my-menu\">\n    <span>My Menu Button</span>\n</ids-menu-button>\n<!-- ... -->\n<ids-popup-menu id=\"my-menu\" target=\"#my-button\">\n    <!-- ... -->\n</ids-popup-menu>\n```\n\nMenu Buttons themselves can have the Dropdown Icon set directly on the markup:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-button id=\"my-button\" menu=\"my-menu\" dropdown-icon>\n    <span>My Menu Button</span>\n</ids-menu-button>\n```\n\nBoth the regular IdsButton `icon` setting and `dropdown-icon` can be used together:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-button id=\"my-button\" menu=\"my-menu\" icon=\"settings\" dropdown-icon>\n    <span>My Menu Button</span>\n</ids-menu-button>\n```\n\nThe Dropdown Icon can be customized, if necessary:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-button id=\"my-button\" menu=\"my-menu\" dropdown-icon=\"launch\">\n    <span>My Menu Button</span>\n</ids-menu-button>\n```\n\nThe button can set as formatter width and style:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu-button id=\"my-button\" menu=\"my-menu\" formatter-width=\"125px\" dropdown-icon>\n    <span>My Menu Button</span>\n</ids-menu-button>\n```\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Enter/Return</kbd> When the Button is focused, will cause the menu to toggle open/closed.\n- <kbd>Enter/Return</kbd> When the Popup Menu Items are focused, performs selection/deselection where available.  On items that contain submenus, this will not select/deselect and will instead trigger the submenu.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- When the menu is opened, it will intelligently decide which direction to flow.  If there is more space between the top of the button and the top of the viewport (compared to the bottom of the button/viewport), it will open above the button.  In some cases, the menu may open to the left/right of the button.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Menu Button was not a \"standard\" component in 4.x, and needed to be created manually.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-menu-button></ids-menu-button>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n- Now exists as its own component\n- Implicitly linked to a menu by using `menu=\"my-menu\"` CSS selector attribute, or direct element reference in JS\n"

        "value": "# Ids Toolbar Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Ids Toolbar is used for building highly-configurable Toolbars for sections of your application.  It displays [buttons](../ids-button/README.md), hyperlinks, and other components in different align-able sections, along with contextual information about a workflow or process.\n\nThe Ids Toolbar can also be responsive, intelligently hiding buttons that can't be shown on-screen, and displaying them in an overflow menu.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Provides contextual information for a workflow or process displayed on screen\n- Provides access to contextual actions for said workflow/process\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Section** Toolbars are divided into sections.  Each of these sections has their own alignment style and \"type\" that determines how it fits within the Toolbar.\n**Item** Toolbar items are the actionable elements within a toolbar.  In general they correspond standard HTML Elements or other IDS Components, such as buttons, hyperlinks, checkboxes, etc.\n**More Actions** This optional element can be applied to Toolbars that contain a significant number of actions that cannot all be displayed on screen at one time.  This element contains a menu button that will display any \"spilled-over\" contents from the Toolbar when active, once those actions are no longer visible on the Toolbar.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n### Toolbar\n\n- `disabled` makes the entire toolbar enabled/disabled\n- `focused` describes the currently-focused Toolbar item\n- `items` provides access to all Toolbar items in all sections\n- `sections` provides access to all the Toolbar's sections\n- `separators` provides access to all the Toolbar's separators\n- `tabbable` if true, makes it possible to navigate all Toolbar items by using the Tab/Shift+Tab keys by setting all items to a 0-or-more tabIndex property.  By default (false), only one Toolbar item at a time can have a 0-or-more tabIndex.\n\n### Toolbar Section\n\n- `align` - Determines the alignment of the items within this section.  Defaults to `start`, which is the left side of the Toolbar in a standard Left-to-Right toolbar setup.  Can also be `center` and `end` (right).\n- `favor` - Determines if this section should not shrink/collapse when the size of the entire Toolbar shrinks. This causes the other Toolbar sections to become smaller first.\n- `items` - provides access to all Toolbar items in this section.\n- `type` - Sets a pre-defined \"type\" on the toolbar section. This defaults to `static` but can also be set to `title`, `buttonset`, and `search` to mimic those specific sections. To create a custom section that fills available space, `fluid` is also an available type. Type `button` is for a single button in the section to maintain button's focus state.\n\n### Toolbar More Actions\n\n- `button` provides access to the internal [Menu Button component](../ids-menu-button/README.md)\n- `menu` provides access to the internal [Popup Menu component](../ids-popup-menu/README.md)\n- `overflow` if true, menu items that cannot be displayed in the main Toolbar area due to lack of space will be \"mirrored\" and generated as menu items in a special group inside this menu.  Clicking the mirrored menu items will cause the original Toolbar action to be fired.  When a [Menu Button](../ids-menu-button/README.md) component is mirrored, its attached menu is also mirrored as a submenu on its generated menu item.\n- `type` this component is a standalone toolbar section that always reports `more` for its type.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- \"disabled\"\n- \"tabbable\"\n\nAside from the Toolbar-level disabled state, all individual Toolbar items are responsible for management of their own state.  For more information on these components' states, see their documentation pages.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nIds Toolbars are comprised of the Toolbar element, an indeterminate number of Toolbar sections, and an optional \"More Actions\" menu button element. Inside of the different toolbar sections, it's possible to place different Ids Components.  Below is a basic example of what an entire Ids Toolbar may look like:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n        <ids-text type=\"h3\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Text</span>\n        </ids-button>\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n            <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n            <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n        <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>More Options\n            <ids-popup-menu>\n                <ids-menu-group>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n                </ids-menu-group>\n            </ids-popup-menu>\n            </ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    </ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n</ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### Sections\n\nToolbar sections can be configured with different \"types\" that can determine their look/feel/function.  By default, the sections do not fill available space and contain no padding.  These are `static` toolbar sections:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-button icon=\"menu\" role=\"button\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Application Menu Trigger</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nFor compatibility with 4.x components Toolbars, the IDS Toolbar also supports `title` and `buttonset` section types that act similarly.  The styling is less rigid than in previous iterations, so to make a `buttonset` section \"right\"-aligned, it's necessary to add the `align=\"end\"` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Title sections can have multiple text elements, if needed:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n\n<!-- or... -->\n\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Buttonset sections can contain an indeterminate number of components.  Generally these are [Buttons](../ids-button/README.md), but other component types such as Hyperlinks and some Pickers are accepted.  The Buttonset Section is styled with CSS to prevent the wrapping of these elements to multiple lines, instead cutting off actions that don't fit.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-3\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-4\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbars can also contain sections that are meant to be customized with CSS.  It's possible to create custom static sections with the `static` type, but if you want to make a custom section that fills available space, use the `fluid` type:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <!-- takes up as little space as possible --->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"static\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 1</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n\n    <!-- fills the rest of the toolbar space -->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"fluid\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 2</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\nThe toolbar can be set as the formatter styles:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar type=\"formatter\">\n  <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 1</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-separator vertical></ids-separator>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 2</span>\n    </ids-button>\n  </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### More Actions Button\n\nOptionally, toolbars can contain a \"More Actions\" Button, which is a [Menu Button]('../ids-menu-button/README.md) wrapped inside a special Toolbar Section.  This component's purpose is to provide ansulary actions that are related to your Toolbar's primary actions, but don't necessarily need to be readily available on a single click.  In responsive settings with many primary actions present, the Toolbar will collapse any actions that don't fit within its boundaries.  Optionally, the More Actions menu can display these collapsed actions at the top of its menu (also referred to as the \"overflow\" menu).\n\nThe Ids Toolbar More Actions component sits alongside the other toolbar sections, and contains a single slot that takes the same types of elements as a standard [Ids Popup Menu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md):\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item>More Options\n        <ids-popup-menu>\n            <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n            </ids-menu-group>\n        </ids-popup-menu>\n        </ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\nIf accompanied by a More Actions button with the `overflow` attribute set, Toolbar Actions that don't fit within their sections will be hidden in the Toolbar, but will also \"spill over\" into the More Actions menu, inside a special `IdsMenuGroup` with a `more-actions` attribute.  If a user clicks on one of the menu items that reflects a Toolbar element, the Toolbar element will also be \"clicked\".  This allows visually-hidden Toolbar actions to still remain available in responsive settings.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions overflow>\n    <!--\n        Toolbar Items will be mirrored here inside a group that looks like:\n        <ids-menu-group more-actions>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    --->\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\n### API Access\n\nAt the Toolbar level, it's possible to access all Items and Sections:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').items;\nconst sections = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').sections;\n```\n\nWithin each section, it's possible to access the section's items:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-section').items;\n```\n\nWhen dealing with a More Actions button, its inner components' APIs are exposed:\n\n```js\nconst moreActionsButtonEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').button;\nconst moreActionsMenuEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').menu;\n```\n\nAccess to the different More Actions menu items is also exposed:\n\n```js\n// These items are defined inside the `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>` element's default slot.\nconst predefinedMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').predefinedMenuItems;\n\n// These items are generated by the More Actions menu if the `overflow` attribute is set.\n// These items mirror the regular Toolbar elements.\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\n```\n\nOverflow menu items also provide a reference to their corresponding Toolbar element:\n\n```js\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\noverflowMenuItems.forEach((item) => {\n  console.info(item.overflowTarget); // <-- Points to the Toolbar button/element/etc\n});\n```\n\n### Events\n\nAll elements inside the Toolbar will fire a `selected` event when clicked.  The `selected` event from the More Actions menu's [IdsPopupMenu]('../ids-popup-menu/README.md) is converted into a Toolbar-compatible event automatically, so only one listener at the Toolbar level is needed:\n\n```js\nconst toolbarEl = document.querySelector('#my-toolbar');\ntoolbarEl.addEventListener('selected', (e) => {\n  console.info(e.detail); // Provides data about the originating element, and overflow status, if applicable\n}\n```\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Button doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLButtonElement:\n\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys selects a toolbar action and executes the action.  On menu buttons, the menu is activated/hidden, and an action is not executed until one of its menu items is selected.\n- <kbd>Left/Right Arrow</kbd> keys navigate the available toolbar items.\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Tab<kbd> keys cause navigation to occur.  When `tabbable=\"true\"`, using Tab/Shift+Tab causes navigation between Toolbar items. When `tabbable=\"false\"`, Navigation away from the toolbar will occur to the element after/before the Toolbar respectively.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Try not to provide an over-abundance of Toolbar Actions.  The Toolbar's intention is to provide contextual actions for a specific workflow. Providing too many actions can cause end-user confusion.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Toolbar was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbar();`\n- Flex Toolbar replaced/deprecated Toolbar in v4.3.0\n- Flex Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbarflex();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Flex Toolbar is now a custom element `<ids-toolbar></ids-toolbar>`\n- Toolbar Sections are now codified as components `<ids-toolbar-section>`\n- More Actions Buttons are now a codified components `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>`\n- Toolbars now implement `tabbable` to enable use of (Shift)/Tab keys for navigation\n- Toolbar Section behavior is now controlled by attributes (`favor`, `type`, etc) instead of CSS classes.\n- Not including a More Actions button in markup explicitly disables the menu from being displayed.\n- The More Actions button can be configured NOT to automatically show overflow items by omitting its `overflow` attribute.  This allows for pre-defined menu items to be displayed without items being spilled over to the overflow menu.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Tabs Component\n\n## Description\n\nTabs are a navigation element used to allow users to easily access different areas of a site or different parts of an individual page. A user can navigate between page sections with a tab. Best for communicating different views of the data, or offering navigation between related data.\nway to highlight which section/content in a page you are currently\nfocused on.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Used when need information to be highly scannable and to simplify navigation.\n- Used when a page needs a more organized structure.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal default horizontal tab component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nA vertical tabs component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" orientation=\"vertical\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nUsing a tab context to show the active tab content in `ids-tab-content`.\n```html\n<ids-tabs-context>\n    <!-- ^ context has no outward styling or content, but width/height or display can be set -->\n    <ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n        <ids-tab value=\"one\">Section 1</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"two\">Section 2</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"three\">Section 3</ids-tab>\n    </ids-tabs>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"one\">\n            This will be initially visible\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"two\">\n            If ids-tabs value=\"two\" is selected, or ids-tab with value \"two\"\n            is set as selected, then this will be visible and one will be hidden\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"three\">\n            And this will show if the ids-tabs value or selection becomes \"three\",\n            similar to the previous content entry. Only one will be shown at once.\n        </ids-tab-content>\n    </div>\n</ids-tabs-context>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to create Module Tabs for top-level navigation in your application\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Overflowed Tabs\n\nWhen creating a tab list with many tabs, its possible there will not be enough screen real-estate to display them all.  In this situation you can also add a special \"More Tabs\" tab component:\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Fixed placement of Tabs and Actions\n\nSome items slotted in IdsTabs should not spill into the \"More Actions\" area and should always be present.  Using the `fixed` slot name on these elements causes them to sit inside a \"fixed\" on the right of the IdsTabs.  In cases where overflow is present, the actions will be adjacent to a visible More Actions tab.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nWhen this component is present in a tab list, it will only be displayed when there is not enough space to display all other tabs present.  When clicking on this tab, it opens an [IdsPopupMenu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) containing menu items that reflect all tabs currently \"overflowed\" (in practice, the tabs that are hidden).  Selecting an item from the menu causes the menu item's corresponding tab to be activated.\n\n### Dismissible Tabs\n\nTabs can be configured to display an optional [IdsTriggerButton](../ids-trigger-field/README.md) (marked with an \"X\") that will remove it from the tab list when clicked.  If a content pane with a matching `value` attribute exists, the IdsTabsContext element locates and removes it. When a tab is dismissed, it emits a `tabremove` event.\n\n```html\n<ids-tab value=\"one\" dismissible>Example One</dismissible>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n### Tab Container Settings (`ids-tabs`)\n- `disabled` {boolean} disables all tabs.\n- `value` {string} set which tab is currently selected. If tab children do not have a value, will fall back to being a 0-based index. Otherwise, it can also be any string as long as there are relevant matches for the values.\n- `orientation` {'horizontal' | 'vertical'} defaults to horizontal; controls the direction/axis tabs are flowed on.\n- `color-variant` {'alternate'|'module'} (optional) sets the Tabs color variant.  The `alternate` variant is used on header components and set automatically when placed inside of an `ids-header` component.  The `module` variant displays Module Tabs, which are generally used as top-level navigation only.\n\n### Individual Tabs Settings (`ids-tab`)\n- `actionable` {boolean} labels a tab as having a corresponding action, such as \"Add\", \"Reset\", \"Activate Application Menu\", etc.  Tabs that use this setting should also have an `onAction` callback applied, which will be triggered upon selecting the tab.  Tabs that are `actionable` will not cause content in tab panels to be displayed.\n- `disabled` {boolean} allows you to disable a tab among a set of tabs.\n- `selected` {boolean} allows for a tab to display its selected state.  In some cases, tabs with this value set to true will also automatically display their corresponding Tab Panel's content.  Tabs that have an `actionable` attribute applied are not able to be \"selected\" -- selecting those tabs will focus them.\n- `value` {string | number} the value which when the parent `ids-tabs` also has an equivalent for, selects this tab.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n### IdsTabs\n- `container` allows you to style the container of the tab\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\nWhen placed inside of an `IdsHeader` component, the `ids-tabs` component automatically gains the property `color-variant` which is set to `alternate` as it's default style.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- TAB should move off of the component to the next focusable element on page.\n- SHIFT + TAB should move to previous focusable element on the page.\n- Direction keys (UP/DOWN for vertical, LEFT/RIGHT for horizontal) should move between tabs\n- ENTER should select a tab.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container. Possibly scrolling as needed based on parent dimensions.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Tabs was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Tabs can be invoked with `$('#my-element').tabs()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Tabs are now custom elements `<ids-tabs value=${selection}></ids-tabs>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- Content within the tabs are specified as `<ids-tab value=${selection-value}>`Tab Label/Content`</ids-tab>`\n- Tabs and their panels are now wrapped with a context element `<ids-tabs-context></ids-tabs-context>` for controlling which tab is displayed\n- Tabs can optionally display overflow by inserting an `<ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>` component into the `<ids-tabs></ids-tabs>` component\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nTODO\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nText within tabs should be localized in the current language. They should also should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

This component can be used on its own, but its generally used to make other internal components (date picker, time picker ect).\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsTriggerField\n  - IdsInput\n    - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsDirtyTrackerMixin\n  IdsColorVariantMixin\n  IdsClearableMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsKeyboardMixin\n  IdsMaskMixin\n  IdsTooltipMixin\n  IdsValidationMixin\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you want an input with a trigger button/buttons that opens some kind of selection dialog that works with the field.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Trigger**: The button next to the input element\n- **Input**: The input element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nAdd an IdsTriggerField to the page and inside its slot add one or more ids-trigger-buttons.  The `slot` attribute can be applied the IdsTriggerButton to control its placement, but by default they will appear at the \"end\" side of the trigger field:\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field size=\"sm\" label=\"Date Field\">\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"end\">\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Date Field trigger</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"schedule\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\nExample usage with buttons on both sides of input.\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field\n    id=\"trigger-field-1\"\n    label=\"Trigger field label\"\n>\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"start\">\n    <ids-icon class=\"ids-settings\" icon=\"settings\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Call to action Button</ids-text>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"end\">\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Popup Activator Button</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon class=\"ids-dropdown\" icon=\"dropdown\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\nThe `inline` attribute can be applied the IdsTriggerButton to alter the size of the field when the field height changes. Since trigger buttons are \"square\", they will respect the settings and fit the size of the field.\n\nExample usage with `inline` attribute enabled in ids-trigger-buttons.\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field size=\"sm\" label=\"Select an option\">\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"trigger-end\" inline>\n    <ids-text>Show options</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"dropdown\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n**Ids Trigger Field Component**\n  - `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n  - `label` {string} This adds a label to the trigger field\n  - `size` {string} set the input size, it will set `md` as defaults\n  - `tabbable` {boolean} Turns on the functionality allow the trigger to be tabbable. For accessibility reasons this should be on in most cases and this is the default.\n  - `delimiter` {string} The delimiter to use when multiple values are selected.\n\n**Ids Trigger Button Component**\n  - `inline` {boolean} when some components alter the trigger button style to enable `inline`, it will:\n    - Set one visible border on the trigger botton:\n      - left side if slotted with \"trigger-end\"\n      - right side if slotted with \"trigger-start\"\n    - Alter the size of the trigger button to fit the size of the field if `field-height` or `compact` are set on IdsTriggerField.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- No separate Trigger Field component is present in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- IdsTriggerField is a new component for 5.x\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nIn Right To Left Languages the trigger field and alignment will flow to the other side.\n"

It can set to various types, size, and functionality. IDS Input will add `aria-required` for required elements.\n- Label: HTMLLabelElement to keep matching with HTMLInputElement. Make sure the input label has a meaningful relative to input. IDS Input will add sudo ui `*` for required elements.\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nA standard Text Input is a basic input element:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"First Name\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the types, available types are `'text'|'password'|'email'|'color'` and default type is `type=\"text\"`.\n\n```html\n<ids-input type=\"password\" label=\"Xtra Small\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the sizes, available sizes are `'xs'|'sm'|'mm'|'md'|'lg'|'full'` and default type is `size=\"md\"`.\n\n```html\n<ids-input size=\"xs\" label=\"Xtra Small\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nAdd an Disabled Text Input this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Disabled\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nAdd an Readonly Text Input this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Readonly\" readonly=\"true\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the Dirty Tracking to Text Input this way. You can also call `resetDirtyTracker()` to reset the dirty tracking icon:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Dirty Tracking\" dirty-tracker=\"true\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Text Input this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Last Name\" validate=\"required\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the input to clearable and add a clear button:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Clearable\" clearable=\"true\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the Auto Select to Text Input this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Autoselect\" value=\"Text select on focus\" autoselect=\"true\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the Text Align to Text Input this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"Default align (left)\" value=\"Default align\"></ids-input>\n<ids-input label=\"Left align\" value=\"Left align\" text-align=\"start\"></ids-input>\n<ids-input label=\"Center align\" value=\"Center align\" text-align=\"center\"></ids-input>\n<ids-input label=\"Right align\" value=\"Right align\" text-align=\"end\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet the caps lock alert indicator this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"password\" caps-lock=\"true\" type=\"password\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet up for displaying the show/hide password button:\n\n```html\n<ids-input label=\"password\" revealable-text=\"true\" password-visible=\"false\" type=\"password\"></ids-input>\n```\n\nSet up for autocomplete input\n\n```html\n  <ids-input\n    id=\"input-autocomplete\"\n    placeholder=\"This input's label is visible\"\n    size=\"md\"\n    label=\"Autocomplete Input\"\n    autocomplete\n    search-field=\"label\"\n  >\n  </ids-input>\n```\n\n```js\nimport statesJSON from '../../../assets/data/states.json';\n\nconst input: any = document.querySelector('#input-autocomplete');\nconst url: any = statesJSON;\n\nconst setData = async () => {\n  const res = await fetch(url);\n  const data = await res.json();\n  input.data = data;\n};\n\nsetData();\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `autocomplete` can be set to true to enable autocomplete functionality.\n- `autoselect` {boolean} set auto select text on focus to input.\n- `bgTransparent` {boolean} set the transparent background to readonly input.\n- `clearable` {boolean} set (x) button to clear text on click/key to input.

See [Ids Dirty Tracker Mixin](../../mixins/ids-dirty-tracker-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `fieldHeight` {string} defines the height of the input field. See [Ids Field Height Mixin](../../mixins/ids-field-height-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `labelState` {string} indicates that a label is hidden (note that for accessibility reasons, `label` should still be specified). See [Ids Label State Mixin](../../mixins/ids-label-state-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `mask` {array|function} defines how to mask the input.  See [Ids Mask Mixin](../ids-mask/README.md) for more information.\n- `noMargins` {boolean} sets whether or not no-margins around the component.\n- `password-visible` {boolean} sets whether the password is currently visible must be paired with revealable-text = 'true' and type = 'password'.\n- `placeholder` {string} set the placeholder text to input.\n- `size` {string} set the input size, it will set `md` as defaults.\n- `search-field` when autocomplete is enabled can be set to a string of the field to be searched in the dataset.\n- `revealable-text` {boolean} sets whether the show/hide button is available for password fields must be paired with type='password'\n- `readonly` {boolean} set readonly state.\n- `text-align` {string} set text-align to input, it will set `left` as defaults.\n- `type` {string} set the input type, it will set `text` as defaults.\n- `validate` {string} set the input validation rules, use `space` to add multiple validation rules.\n- `format` {string} if the validation rules include date/time, use the setting to set custom date/time format\n- `validationEvents` {string} set the input validation events, use `space` to add multiple validation rules, it will set `blur` as defaults.\n- `value` {string} set the input value.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Input doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLInputElement:\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the edit field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default size is 300px wide but there are a number of widths.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Block grid / Image List partially replaces the carousel in 3.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The Input component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-input.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-input></ids-input>` (see examples above)\n- Actions next to the input is deprecated, if needed you can code it with a button, popupmenu and input\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events (custom events)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- Can now be use variation of sizes (width/height)\n- If using a clearable X on the input the x is now tabbable by default for accessibility\n\nMarkup comparison:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x input example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n  <label class=\"required\" for=\"last-name\">Last Name</label>\n  <input type=\"text\" id=\"last-name\" aria-required=\"true\" name=\"last-name\" data-validate=\"required\"/>\n</div>\n\n<!-- this is the same input using the WebComponent -->\n<ids-input label=\"Last Name\" id=\"last-name\" name=\"last-name\" validate=\"required\"></ids-input>\n```\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThere should be a label on all inputs to give an indication what the field is containing.\n"

A user can navigate between page sections with a tab. Best for communicating different views of the data, or offering navigation between related data.\nway to highlight which section/content in a page you are currently\nfocused on.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Used when need information to be highly scannable and to simplify navigation.\n- Used when a page needs a more organized structure.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal default horizontal tab component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nA vertical tabs component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" orientation=\"vertical\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nUsing a tab context to show the active tab content in `ids-tab-content`.\n```html\n<ids-tabs-context>\n    <!-- ^ context has no outward styling or content, but width/height or display can be set -->\n    <ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n        <ids-tab value=\"one\">Section 1</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"two\">Section 2</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"three\">Section 3</ids-tab>\n    </ids-tabs>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"one\">\n            This will be initially visible\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"two\">\n            If ids-tabs value=\"two\" is selected, or ids-tab with value \"two\"\n            is set as selected, then this will be visible and one will be hidden\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"three\">\n            And this will show if the ids-tabs value or selection becomes \"three\",\n            similar to the previous content entry. Only one will be shown at once.\n        </ids-tab-content>\n    </div>\n</ids-tabs-context>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to create Module Tabs for top-level navigation in your application\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Overflowed Tabs\n\nWhen creating a tab list with many tabs, its possible there will not be enough screen real-estate to display them all.  In this situation you can also add a special \"More Tabs\" tab component:\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Fixed placement of Tabs and Actions\n\nSome items slotted in IdsTabs should not spill into the \"More Actions\" area and should always be present.  Using the `fixed` slot name on these elements causes them to sit inside a \"fixed\" on the right of the IdsTabs.  In cases where overflow is present, the actions will be adjacent to a visible More Actions tab.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nWhen this component is present in a tab list, it will only be displayed when there is not enough space to display all other tabs present.  When clicking on this tab, it opens an [IdsPopupMenu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) containing menu items that reflect all tabs currently \"overflowed\" (in practice, the tabs that are hidden).  Selecting an item from the menu causes the menu item's corresponding tab to be activated.\n\n### Dismissible Tabs\n\nTabs can be configured to display an optional [IdsTriggerButton](../ids-trigger-field/README.md) (marked with an \"X\") that will remove it from the tab list when clicked.  If a content pane with a matching `value` attribute exists, the IdsTabsContext element locates and removes it. When a tab is dismissed, it emits a `tabremove` event.\n\n```html\n<ids-tab value=\"one\" dismissible>Example One</dismissible>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n### Tab Container Settings (`ids-tabs`)\n- `disabled` {boolean} disables all tabs.\n- `value` {string} set which tab is currently selected. If tab children do not have a value, will fall back to being a 0-based index. Otherwise, it can also be any string as long as there are relevant matches for the values.\n- `orientation` {'horizontal' | 'vertical'} defaults to horizontal; controls the direction/axis tabs are flowed on.\n- `color-variant` {'alternate'|'module'} (optional) sets the Tabs color variant.

The `module` variant displays Module Tabs, which are generally used as top-level navigation only.\n\n### Individual Tabs Settings (`ids-tab`)\n- `actionable` {boolean} labels a tab as having a corresponding action, such as \"Add\", \"Reset\", \"Activate Application Menu\", etc.  Tabs that use this setting should also have an `onAction` callback applied, which will be triggered upon selecting the tab.  Tabs that are `actionable` will not cause content in tab panels to be displayed.\n- `disabled` {boolean} allows you to disable a tab among a set of tabs.\n- `selected` {boolean} allows for a tab to display its selected state.  In some cases, tabs with this value set to true will also automatically display their corresponding Tab Panel's content.

A user can navigate between page sections with a tab. Best for communicating different views of the data, or offering navigation between related data.\nway to highlight which section/content in a page you are currently\nfocused on.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Used when need information to be highly scannable and to simplify navigation.\n- Used when a page needs a more organized structure.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal default horizontal tab component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nA vertical tabs component.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" orientation=\"vertical\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nUsing a tab context to show the active tab content in `ids-tab-content`.\n```html\n<ids-tabs-context>\n    <!-- ^ context has no outward styling or content, but width/height or display can be set -->\n    <ids-tabs value=\"one\">\n        <ids-tab value=\"one\">Section 1</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"two\">Section 2</ids-tab>\n        <ids-tab value=\"three\">Section 3</ids-tab>\n    </ids-tabs>\n    <div class=\"tab-content\">\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"one\">\n            This will be initially visible\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"two\">\n            If ids-tabs value=\"two\" is selected, or ids-tab with value \"two\"\n            is set as selected, then this will be visible and one will be hidden\n        </ids-tab-content>\n        <ids-tab-content value=\"three\">\n            And this will show if the ids-tabs value or selection becomes \"three\",\n            similar to the previous content entry. Only one will be shown at once.\n        </ids-tab-content>\n    </div>\n</ids-tabs-context>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to create Module Tabs for top-level navigation in your application\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Overflowed Tabs\n\nWhen creating a tab list with many tabs, its possible there will not be enough screen real-estate to display them all.  In this situation you can also add a special \"More Tabs\" tab component:\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n### Fixed placement of Tabs and Actions\n\nSome items slotted in IdsTabs should not spill into the \"More Actions\" area and should always be present.  Using the `fixed` slot name on these elements causes them to sit inside a \"fixed\" on the right of the IdsTabs.  In cases where overflow is present, the actions will be adjacent to a visible More Actions tab.\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs value=\"one\" color-variant=\"module\">\n    <ids-tab value=\"one\">Example One</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"two\">Example Two</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"three\">Example Three</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"four\">Example Four</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"five\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Five</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab value=\"six\" slot=\"fixed\">Example Six</ids-tab>\n    <ids-tab-more overflow></ids-tab-more>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\nWhen this component is present in a tab list, it will only be displayed when there is not enough space to display all other tabs present.  When clicking on this tab, it opens an [IdsPopupMenu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md) containing menu items that reflect all tabs currently \"overflowed\" (in practice, the tabs that are hidden).  Selecting an item from the menu causes the menu item's corresponding tab to be activated.\n\n### Dismissible Tabs\n\nTabs can be configured to display an optional [IdsTriggerButton](../ids-trigger-field/README.md) (marked with an \"X\") that will remove it from the tab list when clicked.  If a content pane with a matching `value` attribute exists, the IdsTabsContext element locates and removes it. When a tab is dismissed, it emits a `tabremove` event.\n\n```html\n<ids-tab value=\"one\" dismissible>Example One</dismissible>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n### Tab Container Settings (`ids-tabs`)\n- `disabled` {boolean} disables all tabs.\n- `value` {string} set which tab is currently selected. If tab children do not have a value, will fall back to being a 0-based index. Otherwise, it can also be any string as long as there are relevant matches for the values.\n- `orientation` {'horizontal' | 'vertical'} defaults to horizontal; controls the direction/axis tabs are flowed on.\n- `color-variant` {'alternate'|'module'} (optional) sets the Tabs color variant.

        "value": "# Ids Menu Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe IdsMenu Component provides the ui for a menu. This includes groups, icons, submenus, text, disabled ect. By itself a menu is not very useful and will just paint on the page as if it was open. Use [IdsMenuButton]('../ids-menu-button/README.md') in order to show a menu on a button click. Or use [IdsPopupMenu]('../ids-popup-menu/README.md') to show a menu on a click or right click anywhere on the page. The construction of a menu is comprised of several related components.\n\n`ids-menu-group` is used to create a group for a set of menu items.\n`ids-menu-header` is used a as a label for groups of menu items\n`ids-menu-item` is the main component normal menu items\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Display an application menu\n- Display submenus\n- Display a menu with icons\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Group** A label separating items in the menu in a logical group\n**Submenus** A a list of choices that is part of another list of choices\n\n## Attributes and Properties (ids-menu-group)\n\n- `disabled` {boolean} true if the entire menu should become disabled\n- `keep-open` {boolean} true if selection of an item within this group should cause the parent menu to close\n- `selection` {string} The type of selection to set this group between `single` and `multiple` or `none`\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA simple menu with three items can be created by creating a `ids-menu` with a single `ids-menu-group` and three `ids-menu-item` components.\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"simple-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-menu-item>One</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Two</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Three</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nA menu can have a toggle-able menu item that is indicated with a check that toggles when you turn it on and off. In this example selecting `Two` will mark it checked and unchecked\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"simple-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-menu-item>One</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item toggleable>Two</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Three</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nA more complicated menu can be formed using combinations of  `ids-menu` with a `ids-menu-group` and nested `ids-menu-item` components.\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"complex-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"long-no-icons\">Very long, indescribable action with no icons</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"url\" disabled=\"true\" value=\"big-with-icons\">\n      Another big menu item, but with icons!\n    </ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n  <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n  <ids-menu-header id=\"additional-actions-header\">Additional Actions</ids-menu-header>\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"more-settings\" aria-describedby=\"additional-actions-header\">\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"more-actions\">\n      More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"user\" value=\"even-more-actions\">\n        Even More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item id=\"no-select\" value=\"no-select\">This one can't be selected (Check the console)</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-group id=\"other-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"more\" value=\"other-items\">Other Items</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n### Selection Event Handling\n\nWhen an `<ids-menu-item>` element is selected from a menu, it has the potential to fire up to two different events.  The events fired depend on how the menu is configured.  Consider this menu:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nIn this example, when any of the menu's items are chosen by click or by keyboard, no selection events are fired.  This is because there is no `select` attribute determining single or multiple selection.  The menu item chosen will not change the menu's selection state, and will simply fire a `pick` event.\n\nThis next example will cause a both a `selected` event and a `pick` event to fire whenever an item is chosen.

By itself a menu is not very useful and will just paint on the page as if it was open. Use [IdsMenuButton]('../ids-menu-button/README.md') in order to show a menu on a button click. Or use [IdsPopupMenu]('../ids-popup-menu/README.md') to show a menu on a click or right click anywhere on the page. The construction of a menu is comprised of several related components.\n\n`ids-menu-group` is used to create a group for a set of menu items.\n`ids-menu-header` is used a as a label for groups of menu items\n`ids-menu-item` is the main component normal menu items\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Display an application menu\n- Display submenus\n- Display a menu with icons\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Group** A label separating items in the menu in a logical group\n**Submenus** A a list of choices that is part of another list of choices\n\n## Attributes and Properties (ids-menu-group)\n\n- `disabled` {boolean} true if the entire menu should become disabled\n- `keep-open` {boolean} true if selection of an item within this group should cause the parent menu to close\n- `selection` {string} The type of selection to set this group between `single` and `multiple` or `none`\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA simple menu with three items can be created by creating a `ids-menu` with a single `ids-menu-group` and three `ids-menu-item` components.\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"simple-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-menu-item>One</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Two</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Three</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nA menu can have a toggle-able menu item that is indicated with a check that toggles when you turn it on and off. In this example selecting `Two` will mark it checked and unchecked\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"simple-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-menu-item>One</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item toggleable>Two</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item>Three</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nA more complicated menu can be formed using combinations of  `ids-menu` with a `ids-menu-group` and nested `ids-menu-item` components.\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"complex-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"long-no-icons\">Very long, indescribable action with no icons</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"url\" disabled=\"true\" value=\"big-with-icons\">\n      Another big menu item, but with icons!\n    </ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n  <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n  <ids-menu-header id=\"additional-actions-header\">Additional Actions</ids-menu-header>\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"more-settings\" aria-describedby=\"additional-actions-header\">\n    <ids-menu-item value=\"more-actions\">\n      More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"user\" value=\"even-more-actions\">\n        Even More Actions\n    </ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item id=\"no-select\" value=\"no-select\">This one can't be selected (Check the console)</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n    <ids-separator></ids-separator>\n    <ids-menu-group id=\"other-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"more\" value=\"other-items\">Other Items</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n### Selection Event Handling\n\nWhen an `<ids-menu-item>` element is selected from a menu, it has the potential to fire up to two different events.  The events fired depend on how the menu is configured.  Consider this menu:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nIn this example, when any of the menu's items are chosen by click or by keyboard, no selection events are fired.  This is because there is no `select` attribute determining single or multiple selection.  The menu item chosen will not change the menu's selection state, and will simply fire a `pick` event.\n\nThis next example will cause a both a `selected` event and a `pick` event to fire whenever an item is chosen.  No `deselected` events will fire in this case:\n\n```html\n<ids-menu id=\"my-menu\">\n  <ids-menu-group id=\"main-settings\" select=\"single\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" value=\"mail\">Mail</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"filter\" value=\"filter\">Filter</ids-menu-item>\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\" value=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nYou can also have `toggleable` menu items where the menu item check can be turned on and off. For example\n\n```html\n<ids-menu>\n  <ids-menu-group select=\"single\">\n    <ids-menu-item icon=\"mail\" toggable value=\"mail\">Keep Active</ids-menu-item>\n  </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-menu>\n```\n\nThis next example will cause a either a `selected` OR `deselected` event, as well as a `pick` event, to fire whenever an item is chosen.

        "value": "# Ids Popup Menu Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Ids Popup Menu component allows the capability for providing lists of contextual options related to a current application, page, or widget.  The options within the menu provide values that can be acted on, events that can determine application function, and can contain toggle information.\n\nIds Popup Menus are able to be attached directly to the page, taking the place of standard browser context menus.  They are also able to be attached to specific components, such as buttons, input fields, and grid cells, to provide contextual options specific to those elements.\n\nThe Ids Popup Menu is a complex component that combines an [`IdsMenu`](../ids-menu/README.md) and [`IdsPopup`](./ids-popup/README.md) to create its core functionality.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Provide a list of actionable items related to an entire application (Context Menu behavior)\n- Provide a list of actionable items related to another widget (f.x.: MenuButton behavior, Data Grid cell options)\n- Attach major functions of an application to easily-accessible clicks/touches.\n\n## Terminology\n\n### Component Types\n\n**Menu** The base container element, `IdsMenu`, usually represented in the Shadow DOM with a standard HTML `<div>` tag.\n**Popup Menu** This specific component `IdsPopupMenu`, which wraps a standard menu in a \"Popup\" that can be hidden and shown on command.\n**Menu Item** A sub-component of the `IdsPopupMenu`, which is the actionable item within the menu.  These can have values, be selected or deselected, disabled, and icons.  They are also able to contain Submenus.\n**Menu Group** All menu items exist inside of an `IdsMenuGroup` sub-component type, which contains information about how selection can occur on its contained items. Selection be \"none\" (standard click behavior), \"single\" which allows only a single item in the group to be checked, or \"multi\" which allows any/all items in the group to be selected simultaneously. A menu can be comprised of one or multiple groups of items, and each group's selection within the parent menu is independent of the others.\n**Menu Header** This sub-component describes the contents of a specific Menu Group with an accessible heading, represented in the Shadow DOM with a `<li>`. Only one of these should exist within a Menu Group.\n**Separator** A simple sub-component that visually separates Menu Items.  These can be used either as direct children of the Menu between the Menu Groups (represented in Shadow DOM by a `<div>`), or inside of a Menu Group between the Menu Items (represented in Shadow DOM by a `<li>`).\n**Submenu** Nested `IdsPopupMenu` components that originate from a base Popup Menu.  These are attached to a parent menu item, and can be activated by hovering the menu item with a mouse, tapped, clicked, or by using some keyboard commands.\n\n### Behaviors\n\n**Keep Open** Defined on Menu Groups. The presence of this property causes a Popup Menu to remain open when one of the Menu Group's Menu Items is selected/deselected. The Popup Menu can only be closed by an explicit keyboard action, or by clicking/tapping outside of it. By default, selecting/deselecting a Menu Item will cause the Popup Menu to close.\n**Select** Defined on Menu Groups. This option defines the type of selection possible within the Menu Group. When this option is not present (default), simply selecting an item from the Popup Menu will store it as \"selected\" but not visually represent it as such. If this option exists and is set to \"single\", all Menu Items in the Menu Group will display a single-selectable checkmark when selected, causing the others in the group to become deselected. If this option is set to \"multiple\", each Menu Item in the group can be selected/deselected independently, and will be represented by a multi-selectable checkbox.\n**Target** Defined on Popup Menus. The Popup Menus can have a `target` property defined that will define another element in the page as being the \"actionable\" element for causing the menu to show/hide.\n**Trigger** Defined on Popup Menus. The name of the action that causes the Popup Menu to be displayed. The default behavior for Popup Menus will make them occur on the browser's document-level `contextmenu` event, but the trigger behavior can also occur on a left/right/middle `click`, as well as displaying when invoked by using the `immediate` behavior.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n### Popup Menu\n\n- `target` {HTMLElement} if defined, creates a link between this Popup Menu and another element in the DOM.\n- `trigger` {string} the action on which to activate the Popupmenu. This defaults to `contextmenu`, but can also be `click` or `immediate`.\n\n### Menu Group\n\n- `keep-open` {boolean} if true, causes the parent Popup Menu to remain open when an item within this group is selected/deselected.\n- `select` {string} Determines selection type. This defaults to \"none\", but can be \"single\" or \"multiple\".\n\n### Menu Item\n\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `href` {string} set the `href` attribute on the internal anchor.\n- `icon` {string} set the icon type used on the menu item.\n- `selected` {boolean} sets checkmark/checkbox state, if the menu item is selectable.\n- `submenu` {IdsPopupMenu} links a child Popupmenu to this element, if applicable.\n- `tabindex` {number} set the `tabindex` attribute on the internal anchor.\n- `value` {string} set the radio value.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nIt's possible to create a Popupmenu that stands alone and takes the place of the browser's context menu by default:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup-menu id=\"popupmenu\">\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Three</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-popup-menu>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to recreate this structure in raw Javascript:\n\n```js\nconst menu = new IdsPopupMenu();\nmenu.id = 'popupmenu';\ndocument.body.appendChild(menu);\n\nconst group = new IdsMenuGroup();\nmenu.appendChild(group);\n\nconst itemOne = new IdsMenuItem();\nitemOne.value = 1;\ngroup.appendChild(itemOne);\n\nconst itemTwo = new IdsMenuItem();\nitemTwo.value = 1;\ngroup.appendChild(itemTwo);\n\nconst itemThree = new IdsMenuItem();\nitemThree.value = 1;\ngroup.appendChild(itemThree);\n```\n\nAdditionally, it's possible to use an [IdsDataSource](../../core/README.md#ids-data-source) to populate the Popup Menu dynamically.  The component has a standardize JSON format that can be used to create a menu structure quickly:\n\n```js\nconst menu = new IdsPopupMenu();\nmenu.data = {\n    id: 'popupmenu',\n    contents: [\n        {\n            type: 'group',\n            items: [\n                {\n                    text: 'One',\n                    value: 1\n                },\n                {\n                    text: 'Two',\n                    value: 2\n                },\n                {\n                    text: 'Three',\n                    value: 3\n                },\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\ndocument.body.appendChild(menu);\n```\n\n### Size\n\nIdsPopupMenu accepts `max-height` and `width` properties, which it passes directly into its inner [IdsPopup](../ids-popup/README.md#size) component for sizing:\n\n```html\n<ids-popup-menu id=\"popupmenu\" max-height=\"550px\" width=\"400px\"></ids-popupmenu>\n```\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Replace usage of `.inforContextMenu()` with `.contextmenu()` or `.popupmenu()` (depending on the use case)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Popup Menu is now a custom element `<ids-popup-menu></ids-popup-menu>`.\n- Events triggered by the Popup Menu are now plain JS (for example `selected`/`deselected`)\n- Selection of items is now divided up by Menu Groups `<ids-menu-group></ids-menu-group>`.  Multiple menu groups in each Popup Menu are supported, and selection in one group will not affect selection in other groups.\n- Many previous settings are now attribute-friendly (for example `closeOnSelect` is now a `keep-open` attribute on menu groups).\n- Made dynamic menus possible by using [IdsDataSource](../../core/README.md#ids-data-source)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> Can be used to navigate to the next available menu item with a 0+ tab-index value.\n- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> Does the opposite, navigating to the previous available menu item.\n- <kbd>Up/down arrow</kbd> navigate up and down the list.\n- <kbd>Left/right arrow</kbd> traverses nested Popup Menus.  If the currently-highlighted menu item contains a Submenu, pressing the right arrow will open that Submenu.  If the left arrow is pressed while a nested menu item is focused, its Submenu will be closed and focus will be returned to the parent menu item.\n- <kbd>Enter/Return</kbd> Perform selection/deselection where available.  On items that contain submenus, this will not select/deselect and will instead trigger the submenu.\n- <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> can be used to trigger document-level Popup Menus that are bound to the `contextmenu` event.\n"

By default the action sheet only show on screens at the `sm` (600px) breakpoint. This could be expanded in the future or possibly disabled to allow for the action sheet to show on desktop screens.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **ids-action-sheet**: The action sheet container. Consists of an `ids-overlay` and an unnamed `slot` which will contain the menu.\n- **cancel-button**: The cancel button will close the action sheet. The default text of the button is \"Cancel\", but can be override with the `cancelBtnText` attribute.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\n```html\n<ids-action-sheet id=\"icon-menu\">\n    <ids-menu>\n        <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item text-align=\"center\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item text-align=\"center\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item text-align=\"center\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    </ids-menu>\n</ids-action-sheet>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- **visible**: The state where the action sheet is visible. Can be set by the `visible` attribute.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Enter or Space**: The menu items as well as the cancel btn are actionable via the `Enter` and `Space` keys\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Action Sheet now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- Now called IdsActionSheet with a namespace\n- The tray feature has not been added it is now replaced by a floating action button.\n"

This component consists of different types such as `error`, `warning`, `success`, and `info` that represents its color.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nTypically, these alerts are mostly effective to gain attention of the status of your application. Try to use text along with the alert so that users that cant understand the color difference get the important alert information.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Type**: Type is basically the status of an alert.\n- **Icon**: Icon is the symbol of the alert.\n- **Color**: The type of alert color.\n\n## Feature (With the Code Examples)\n\nAn alert is created by using the `ids-alert` html custom element. It has a `icon` property to set the desire alert icon to use.\n\n```html\n<ids-alert icon=\"info\"></ids-alert>\n<ids-alert icon=\"success\"></ids-alert>\n<ids-alert icon=\"warning\"></ids-alert>\n```\n\nAn alert can be used in a disabled situation so comes with a disabled style\n\n```html\n<ids-alert icon=\"info\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-alert>\n```\n\nAn alert can have a tooltip\n\n```html\n<ids-alert icon=\"error\" tooltip=\"Info about the error\"></ids-alert>\n```\n\nAn alert can use any icon, use the color setting with it to control the icon color\n\n```html\n<ids-alert icon=\"calendar\" color=\"info\" tooltip=\"Calendar Alert\"></ids-alert\n```\n\nAn alert can use any icon size\n\n```html\n<ids-alert icon=\"error\" tooltip=\"Info about the error\"  size=\"small\"></ids-alert>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsAlert\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `icon` {boolean} Set the type of icon / alert to show options include  'alert' | 'success' | 'dirty' | 'error' | 'info' |'pending' | 'new' | 'in-progress' or any other icon in the icon set. For these other icons set the color property as well\n- `disabled` {boolean} Set alert to disabled\n- `tooltip` {string} Sets the string content for a tooltip, for error, success, info, alert the color of the tooltip will change\n- `color` {string} Sets the icon color between error, success, info, warning, caution, amber, amethyst\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `icon` allows you to further style the icon element\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Color\n- Size\n- Alert\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nAlert icons do not have tab stops or keyboard interaction on their own. However, they may be placed in a grid cell or other object that has tab focus.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows within its parent/placement and is usually centered vertically.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe traffic light colors are accessibility violations for contrast, however, the high contrast theme provides an alternative that passes. In addition, in context text should be used as color alone cannot provide the meaning. i.e. Do not use color alone to indicate a state.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Alert now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- The yellow alert is no longer available due to having poor contrast with the background.\n- The names of some alerts (icon setting) have changed\n"

        "kind": "markdown",
        "value": "# Ids Toolbar Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Ids Toolbar is used for building highly-configurable Toolbars for sections of your application.  It displays [buttons](../ids-button/README.md), hyperlinks, and other components in different align-able sections, along with contextual information about a workflow or process.\n\nThe Ids Toolbar can also be responsive, intelligently hiding buttons that can't be shown on-screen, and displaying them in an overflow menu.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Provides contextual information for a workflow or process displayed on screen\n- Provides access to contextual actions for said workflow/process\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Section** Toolbars are divided into sections.  Each of these sections has their own alignment style and \"type\" that determines how it fits within the Toolbar.\n**Item** Toolbar items are the actionable elements within a toolbar.  In general they correspond standard HTML Elements or other IDS Components, such as buttons, hyperlinks, checkboxes, etc.\n**More Actions** This optional element can be applied to Toolbars that contain a significant number of actions that cannot all be displayed on screen at one time.  This element contains a menu button that will display any \"spilled-over\" contents from the Toolbar when active, once those actions are no longer visible on the Toolbar.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n### Toolbar\n\n- `disabled` makes the entire toolbar enabled/disabled\n- `focused` describes the currently-focused Toolbar item\n- `items` provides access to all Toolbar items in all sections\n- `sections` provides access to all the Toolbar's sections\n- `separators` provides access to all the Toolbar's separators\n- `tabbable` if true, makes it possible to navigate all Toolbar items by using the Tab/Shift+Tab keys by setting all items to a 0-or-more tabIndex property.  By default (false), only one Toolbar item at a time can have a 0-or-more tabIndex.\n\n### Toolbar Section\n\n- `align` - Determines the alignment of the items within this section.  Defaults to `start`, which is the left side of the Toolbar in a standard Left-to-Right toolbar setup.  Can also be `center` and `end` (right).\n- `favor` - Determines if this section should not shrink/collapse when the size of the entire Toolbar shrinks. This causes the other Toolbar sections to become smaller first.\n- `items` - provides access to all Toolbar items in this section.\n- `type` - Sets a pre-defined \"type\" on the toolbar section. This defaults to `static` but can also be set to `title`, `buttonset`, and `search` to mimic those specific sections. To create a custom section that fills available space, `fluid` is also an available type. Type `button` is for a single button in the section to maintain button's focus state.\n\n### Toolbar More Actions\n\n- `button` provides access to the internal [Menu Button component](../ids-menu-button/README.md)\n- `menu` provides access to the internal [Popup Menu component](../ids-popup-menu/README.md)\n- `overflow` if true, menu items that cannot be displayed in the main Toolbar area due to lack of space will be \"mirrored\" and generated as menu items in a special group inside this menu.  Clicking the mirrored menu items will cause the original Toolbar action to be fired.  When a [Menu Button](../ids-menu-button/README.md) component is mirrored, its attached menu is also mirrored as a submenu on its generated menu item.\n- `type` this component is a standalone toolbar section that always reports `more` for its type.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- \"disabled\"\n- \"tabbable\"\n\nAside from the Toolbar-level disabled state, all individual Toolbar items are responsible for management of their own state.  For more information on these components' states, see their documentation pages.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nIds Toolbars are comprised of the Toolbar element, an indeterminate number of Toolbar sections, and an optional \"More Actions\" menu button element. Inside of the different toolbar sections, it's possible to place different Ids Components.  Below is a basic example of what an entire Ids Toolbar may look like:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n        <ids-text type=\"h3\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Text</span>\n        </ids-button>\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n            <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n            <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n        <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>More Options\n            <ids-popup-menu>\n                <ids-menu-group>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n                <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n                </ids-menu-group>\n            </ids-popup-menu>\n            </ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    </ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n</ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### Sections\n\nToolbar sections can be configured with different \"types\" that can determine their look/feel/function.  By default, the sections do not fill available space and contain no padding.  These are `static` toolbar sections:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section>\n    <ids-button icon=\"menu\" role=\"button\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Application Menu Trigger</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nFor compatibility with 4.x components Toolbars, the IDS Toolbar also supports `title` and `buttonset` section types that act similarly.  The styling is less rigid than in previous iterations, so to make a `buttonset` section \"right\"-aligned, it's necessary to add the `align=\"end\"` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Title sections can have multiple text elements, if needed:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"14\">With some extra information below</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n\n<!-- or... -->\n\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\">My Toolbar</ids-text>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbar Buttonset sections can contain an indeterminate number of components.  Generally these are [Buttons](../ids-button/README.md), but other component types such as Hyperlinks and some Pickers are accepted.  The Buttonset Section is styled with CSS to prevent the wrapping of these elements to multiple lines, instead cutting off actions that don't fit.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\">\n        <span class=\"audible\">Settings</span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-3\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-4\" role=\"button\">\n        <span>Text</span>\n    </ids-button>\n</ids-toolbar-section>\n```\n\nToolbars can also contain sections that are meant to be customized with CSS.  It's possible to create custom static sections with the `static` type, but if you want to make a custom section that fills available space, use the `fluid` type:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar>\n    <!-- takes up as little space as possible --->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"static\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 1</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n\n    <!-- fills the rest of the toolbar space -->\n    <ids-toolbar-section type=\"fluid\" align=\"end\">\n        <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n            <span>Button 2</span>\n        </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\nThe toolbar can be set as the formatter styles:\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar type=\"formatter\">\n  <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\">\n    <ids-button id=\"button-1\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 1</span>\n    </ids-button>\n    <ids-separator vertical></ids-separator>\n    <ids-button id=\"button-2\" role=\"button\">\n      <span>Button 2</span>\n    </ids-button>\n  </ids-toolbar-section>\n<ids-toolbar>\n```\n\n### More Actions Button\n\nOptionally, toolbars can contain a \"More Actions\" Button, which is a [Menu Button]('../ids-menu-button/README.md) wrapped inside a special Toolbar Section.  This component's purpose is to provide ansulary actions that are related to your Toolbar's primary actions, but don't necessarily need to be readily available on a single click.  In responsive settings with many primary actions present, the Toolbar will collapse any actions that don't fit within its boundaries.  Optionally, the More Actions menu can display these collapsed actions at the top of its menu (also referred to as the \"overflow\" menu).\n\nThe Ids Toolbar More Actions component sits alongside the other toolbar sections, and contains a single slot that takes the same types of elements as a standard [Ids Popup Menu](../ids-popup-menu/README.md):\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item>More Options\n        <ids-popup-menu>\n            <ids-menu-group>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"4\">Option Four</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"5\">Option Five</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item value=\"6\">Option Six</ids-menu-item>\n            </ids-menu-group>\n        </ids-popup-menu>\n        </ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\nIf accompanied by a More Actions button with the `overflow` attribute set, Toolbar Actions that don't fit within their sections will be hidden in the Toolbar, but will also \"spill over\" into the More Actions menu, inside a special `IdsMenuGroup` with a `more-actions` attribute.  If a user clicks on one of the menu items that reflects a Toolbar element, the Toolbar element will also be \"clicked\".  This allows visually-hidden Toolbar actions to still remain available in responsive settings.\n\n```html\n<ids-toolbar-more-actions overflow>\n    <!--\n        Toolbar Items will be mirrored here inside a group that looks like:\n        <ids-menu-group more-actions>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item icon=\"settings\">Settings</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n            <ids-menu-item>Text</ids-menu-item>\n        </ids-menu-group>\n    --->\n    <ids-menu-group>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"1\">Option One</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"2\">Option Two</ids-menu-item>\n        <ids-menu-item value=\"3\">Option Three</ids-menu-item>\n    </ids-menu-group>\n</ids-toolbar-more-actions>\n```\n\n### API Access\n\nAt the Toolbar level, it's possible to access all Items and Sections:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').items;\nconst sections = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar').sections;\n```\n\nWithin each section, it's possible to access the section's items:\n\n```js\nconst items = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-section').items;\n```\n\nWhen dealing with a More Actions button, its inner components' APIs are exposed:\n\n```js\nconst moreActionsButtonEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').button;\nconst moreActionsMenuEl = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').menu;\n```\n\nAccess to the different More Actions menu items is also exposed:\n\n```js\n// These items are defined inside the `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>` element's default slot.\nconst predefinedMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').predefinedMenuItems;\n\n// These items are generated by the More Actions menu if the `overflow` attribute is set.\n// These items mirror the regular Toolbar elements.\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\n```\n\nOverflow menu items also provide a reference to their corresponding Toolbar element:\n\n```js\nconst overflowMenuItems = document.querySelector('ids-toolbar-more-actions').overflowMenuItems;\noverflowMenuItems.forEach((item) => {\n  console.info(item.overflowTarget); // <-- Points to the Toolbar button/element/etc\n});\n```\n\n### Events\n\nAll elements inside the Toolbar will fire a `selected` event when clicked.  The `selected` event from the More Actions menu's [IdsPopupMenu]('../ids-popup-menu/README.md) is converted into a Toolbar-compatible event automatically, so only one listener at the Toolbar level is needed:\n\n```js\nconst toolbarEl = document.querySelector('#my-toolbar');\ntoolbarEl.addEventListener('selected', (e) => {\n  console.info(e.detail); // Provides data about the originating element, and overflow status, if applicable\n}\n```\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Button doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLButtonElement:\n\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> keys selects a toolbar action and executes the action.  On menu buttons, the menu is activated/hidden, and an action is not executed until one of its menu items is selected.\n- <kbd>Left/Right Arrow</kbd> keys navigate the available toolbar items.\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>/<kbd>Tab<kbd> keys cause navigation to occur.  When `tabbable=\"true\"`, using Tab/Shift+Tab causes navigation between Toolbar items. When `tabbable=\"false\"`, Navigation away from the toolbar will occur to the element after/before the Toolbar respectively.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Try not to provide an over-abundance of Toolbar Actions.  The Toolbar's intention is to provide contextual actions for a specific workflow. Providing too many actions can cause end-user confusion.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Toolbar was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbar();`\n- Flex Toolbar replaced/deprecated Toolbar in v4.3.0\n- Flex Toolbar has new markup and can be invoked with `$('#my-toolbar').toolbarflex();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Flex Toolbar is now a custom element `<ids-toolbar></ids-toolbar>`\n- Toolbar Sections are now codified as components `<ids-toolbar-section>`\n- More Actions Buttons are now a codified components `<ids-toolbar-more-actions>`\n- Toolbars now implement `tabbable` to enable use of (Shift)/Tab keys for navigation\n- Toolbar Section behavior is now controlled by attributes (`favor`, `type`, etc) instead of CSS classes.\n- Not including a More Actions button in markup explicitly disables the menu from being displayed.\n- The More Actions button can be configured NOT to automatically show overflow items by omitting its `overflow` attribute.  This allows for pre-defined menu items to be displayed without items being spilled over to the overflow menu.\n"

The `slot` attribute can be applied the IdsTriggerButton to control its placement, but by default they will appear at the \"end\" side of the trigger field:\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field size=\"sm\" label=\"Date Field\">\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"end\">\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Date Field trigger</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"schedule\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\nExample usage with buttons on both sides of input.\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field\n    id=\"trigger-field-1\"\n    label=\"Trigger field label\"\n>\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"start\">\n    <ids-icon class=\"ids-settings\" icon=\"settings\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Call to action Button</ids-text>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"end\">\n    <ids-text audible=\"true\">Popup Activator Button</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon class=\"ids-dropdown\" icon=\"dropdown\" size=\"medium\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\nThe `inline` attribute can be applied the IdsTriggerButton to alter the size of the field when the field height changes. Since trigger buttons are \"square\", they will respect the settings and fit the size of the field.\n\nExample usage with `inline` attribute enabled in ids-trigger-buttons.\n\n```html\n<ids-trigger-field size=\"sm\" label=\"Select an option\">\n  <ids-trigger-button slot=\"trigger-end\" inline>\n    <ids-text>Show options</ids-text>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"dropdown\"></ids-icon>\n  </ids-trigger-button>\n</ids-trigger-field>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n**Ids Trigger Field Component**\n  - `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n  - `label` {string} This adds a label to the trigger field\n  - `size` {string} set the input size, it will set `md` as defaults\n  - `tabbable` {boolean} Turns on the functionality allow the trigger to be tabbable. For accessibility reasons this should be on in most cases and this is the default.\n  - `delimiter` {string} The delimiter to use when multiple values are selected.\n\n**Ids Trigger Button Component**\n  - `inline` {boolean} when some components alter the trigger button style to enable `inline`, it will:\n    - Set one visible border on the trigger botton:\n      - left side if slotted with \"trigger-end\"\n      - right side if slotted with \"trigger-start\"\n    - Alter the size of the trigger button to fit the size of the field if `field-height` or `compact` are set on IdsTriggerField.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- No separate Trigger Field component is present in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- IdsTriggerField is a new component for 5.x\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nIn Right To Left Languages the trigger field and alignment will flow to the other side.\n"

        "value": "# Ids App Menu\n\nThe Ids App Menu serves as primary navigation for an Infor Application, combining top level functions of the application with user authentication and access to changing roles.\n\nThe App Menu is built on top of `[IdsDrawer](../ids-drawer/README.md) and generally utilizes an [IdsAccordion](../ids-accordion/README.md) and/or [IdsToolbar](../ids-toolbar/README.md) for its navigation features.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Top-level navigation for your application\n- Access to application-wide features\n- Access to different user roles\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **App Menu Branding** - A slotted area that can be used for application branding info, such as a logo. Its recommended to use the customer logo, not the infor logo.\n- **App Menu Content** - The primary slotted area that usually houses an [IdsAccordion](../ids-accordion/README.md) or some other navigation structure.\n- **App Menu Header** - A slotted area that can be used for extra navigation or text content that sits above the main App Menu content area.\n- **App Menu Footer** - A slotted area that can be used for extra navigation or text content that sits below the main App Menu content area.\n- **App Menu Search** - A slotted area that can be used for adding a search feature for App Menu functionality.\n- **App Menu User Info** - A slotted area that can contain information specific to the \"User\" accessing the application.\n\n## Features (with code samples)\n\nA barebones App Menu can consist of only an accordion for navigation:\n\n```html\n<ids-app-menu id=\"app-menu\">\n    <ids-accordion>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"user\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Employee</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"distribution\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Manager</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"roles\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Recruiter</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n    </ids-accordion>\n</ids-app-menu>\n```\n\nFor more examples of Accordion customization, please see [the Accordion documentation](../ids-accordion/README.md)\n\n### Toolbars\n\nApp Menus can contain small [Toolbars](../ids-toolbar/README.md) that sit above and below the main navigation area.  These toolbars will ideally contain supporting functions that are application-specific, but not necessarily the most important top-level features of the application.\n\nTo include these Toolbars, simply add them to the App Menu's markup with `[slot=\"header\"]` or `[slot=\"footer\"]`:\n\n```html\n<ids-app-menu id=\"app-menu\">\n  <ids-toolbar slot=\"header\">\n    <ids-toolbar-section align=\"center-even\" type=\"fluid\">\n      <ids-button id=\"header-btn-download\" icon=\"download\">\n        <ids-text audible>Download</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n      <ids-button id=\"header-btn-print\" icon=\"print\">\n        <ids-text audible>Print</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n      <ids-button id=\"header-btn-purchasing\" icon=\"purchasing\">\n        <ids-text audible>Purchasing</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n  </ids-toolbar>\n\n  <!-- ... -->\n  <ids-toolbar slot=\"footer\">\n    <ids-toolbar-section align=\"center-even\" type=\"fluid\">\n      <ids-button id=\"footer-btn-settings\">\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n        <span>Settings</span>\n      </ids-button>\n      <ids-button id=\"footer-btn-proxy\" icon=\"employee-directory\">\n        <ids-text audible>Proxy as User</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n      <ids-button id=\"footer-btn-about\" icon=\"info-linear\">\n        <ids-text audible>About This Application</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n      <ids-button id=\"footer-btn-logout\" icon=\"logout\">\n        <ids-text audible>Logout</ids-text>\n      </ids-button>\n    </ids-toolbar-section>\n  </ids-toolbar>\n</ids-app-menu>\n```\n\n### User Information and Roles\n\nApp Menus reserve two slots for specific user information:\n\n- Avatars (User photos)\n- Name\n\n```html\n<ids-app-menu id=\"app-menu\">\n  <!-- Avatar/Username Area -->\n  <img slot=\"avatar\" src=\"../assets/images/avatar-placeholder.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Richard Fairbanks\" />\n  <ids-text slot=\"username\" font-size=\"24\" font-weight=\"semi-bold\">Richard Fairbanks</ids-text>\n</ids-app-menu>\n```\n\n### Search Field\n\nApp Menus can apply filtering capability to their navigation accordion elements by adding an [IdsSearchField](../ids-search-field/README.md) component with `slot=\"search\"` applied:\n\n```html\n<ids-app-menu id=\"app-menu\">\n    <!-- Search Area -->\n    <ids-search-field id=\"search\" slot=\"search\" label=\"\"></ids-search-field>\n\n    <!-- Accordion Nav -->\n    <ids-accordion>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"user\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Employee</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"distribution\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Manager</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n        <ids-accordion-panel>\n            <ids-accordion-header slot=\"header\" icon=\"roles\">\n                <ids-text font-size=\"16\">Recruiter</ids-text>\n            </ids-accordion-header>\n        </ids-accordion-panel>\n    </ids-accordion>\n</ids-app-menu>\n```\n\nIn the previous example, when typing \"Re\" into the search field, the \"Employee\" and \"Manager\" accordion headers will be visually hidden.  Removing the search field's value causes the filter to be reset, and all headers will be visible again.\n\nWhile a filter is applied, accordion headers that do not match the filter are tagged with a `hidden-by-filter` attribute.\n\nThis feature is also applied to nested accordion navigation.  While filtered, headers that don't match the filter will be completely hidden if they have no matching children, but will appear \"faded out\" if they do contain at least one matching child.  These headers are also tagged with a `child-filter-match` attribute.\n\n## States and Variations\n\nThe App Menu doesn't contain any states or variants of its own, but applies the following to its extensions and sub-components:\n\n- App Menu uses the `app-menu` style of [IdsDrawer]('../ids-drawer/README.md').\n- Any \"Top-Level\" [IdsAccordion](../ids-accordion/README.md) panels added to the App Menu receive the `app-menu` color variant\n- Any \"nested\" IdsAccordion panels added to the App Menu receive the `sub-app-menu` color variant.\n- Any [IdsButton](../ids-button/README.md) components inside the App Menu in any slot will be converted to the `alternate` color variant.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Escape**: When focus is on an element inside an open App Menu, the App Menu will close.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-app-menu></ids-app-menu`>\nSections are now slotted for easier use.  Accordion is the main slot, and other areas (toolbars, user info, etc) are named slots.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The names of some alerts (icon setting) have changed\n"

Empty messages appear in ids-cards, ids-data-grid and other places like forms. The component supports action buttons, provides styling for a label and secondary description and optional empty-message specific icons.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When no content is present, an empty message is useful to communicate information & action. It is critical to communicate why it’s empty and what the user can do.\n## Terminology\n- **icon**: this property when included and provided with a supported icon id will display the chosen icon in the empty message format\n- **label**: this is a web component slot, the contents of this slot are treated as a primary label and are styled accordingly\n- **description**: this is a web component slot, the contents of this slot are formatted as secondary text in the ids-empty-message format\n- **button**: this is a slot that is used for any button inputs for the empty message\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` allows for the styling of the container element\n\n## Features\n\nA simple implementation of the empty-message component\n\n```html\n  <ids-empty-message icon=\"empty-no-tasks\">\n    <ids-text type=\"h2\" font-size=\"20\" label=\"true\" slot=\"label\">Document Management</ids-text>\n    <ids-text label=\"true\" slot=\"description\">Description of empty message that explains why.</ids-text>\n    <ids-button class=\"action-button\" slot=\"button\" appearance=\"primary\">\n      <span>BUTTON NAME</span>\n    </ids-button>\n  </ids-empty-message>\n```\n\nWhen making use of the `icon` property, it is important to remember that only empty message specific icon options are valid. Here is a complete list:\n\n`empty-error-loading`\n`empty-generic`\n`empty-new-project`\n`empty-no-alerts`\n`empty-no-analytics`\n`empty-no-budget`\n`empty-no-data`\n`empty-no-events`\n`empty-no-notes`\n`empty-no-orders`\n`empty-no-tasks`\n`empty-no-users`\n`empty-search-data`\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- **icon** the attribute for adding an icon to the empty message, also has bound property with getter/setter\n\n## Accessibility\n\nIt is important to remember to always include a label or description with an Icon for screen reader users.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- This is a new concept that did not exist in 3.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The EmptyMessage component has been changed to a web component and renamed to `<ids-empty-message>`.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-empty-message>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The icon, label, description and button-text are set via properties/attributes.\n"

Generally it should not be used on its own but if you have a case of making some other chart it could be used.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you want a chart with x and y axis and control over whats rendered in it.\n\n## Usage Considerations\n\n- Do not show too many lines at once as it may be difficult to interpret.\n- Hover tooltips should only be used to reveal additional non-critical information.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Marker**: A UI embellishments that shows the data points (i.e. the dots on a line chart).\n- **Domain**: The domain is all x-values (the values of the graph from left to right)\n- **Range**: The domain is all y-values (the values of the graph from down to up)\n- **Scale**: The range of values in the graph (the values of the graph from down to up) and the amount of steps between each value.\n- **Axis**: Charts typically have two axes that are used to measure and categorize data: a vertical axis (also known as value axis or y axis), and a horizontal axis (also known as category axis or x axis).\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA axis chart is defined with a custom element with a width and height.\n\n```html\n<ids-axis-chart title=\"A line chart showing component usage\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\"></ids-axis-chart>\n```\n\nDatasets can be added to the line chart by passing in an array of objects. Each object must have a `data` and object with `name` and `values` from the data points. Also a name should be given for each data object which will be used as the legend text. The `shortName` is used to show the short name of the legend text and the `abbrName` is used to show an even shorter name of the legend text in responsive situations.\n\n```html\nconst dataset = [{\n  data: [{\n    name: 'Jan',\n    value: 1\n  }, {\n    name: 'Feb',\n    value: 2\n  }, {\n    name: 'Mar',\n    value: 3\n  }, {\n    name: 'Apr',\n    value: 5\n  }, {\n    name: 'May',\n    value: 7\n  }, {\n    name: 'Jun',\n    value: 10\n  }],\n  name: 'Component A',\n  shortName: 'Comp A',\n  abbrName: 'A',\n}];\n\ndocument.querySelector('ids-axis-chart').data = dataset;\n```\n\nInside the chart you should provide a chartTemplate that returns the inside (markers) of the chart as svg. The `lineMarkers` element will contain the correct points and position of the markers to use based on the data/height/width/margins of the chart.\n\n```js\nchartTemplate() {\n  return `<g class=\"markers\">\n    ${this.lineMarkers().markers}\n  </g>\n  <g class=\"marker-lines\">\n    ${this.lineMarkers().lines}\n  </g>\n  <g class=\"areas\">\n    ${this.#areas()}\n  </g>`;\n}\n```\n\nYou can also customize the empty message contents but adding an `ids-empty-element` to the slot.\n\n```html\n<ids-axis-chart title=\"A line chart showing component usage\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\">\n    <ids-empty-message slot=\"empty-message\"icon=\"empty-no-data\" hidden>\n        <ids-text type=\"h2\" font-size=\"20\" label=\"true\" slot=\"label\">No Data Right Now</ids-text>\n    </ids-empty-message>\n</ids-axis-chart>\n```\n\nAnother type of chart you can use is a sequential color chart. A sequence of colors is used to represent various concepts of range in low-high density, quantity, and concentration situations. I.E. The data is highly related and should be represented with a single color.\n\nTo achieve this it is recommended to use the `color` setting and pick one of the Ids Colors in the color palette and use variables in its range. For example:\n\n```js\n[{\n   \"data\": [],\n   \"name\": \"Component A\",\n   \"color\": \"var(--ids-color-azure-60)\n }, {\n   \"data\": [],\n   \"name\": \"Component B\",\n   \"shortName\": \"Comp B\",\n   \"abbreviatedName\": \"B\",\n   \"color\": \"var(--ids-color-azure-40)\"\n }, {\n   \"data\": [{\n   ],\n   \"name\": \"Component C\",\n   \"color\": \"var(--ids-color-azure-20)\"\n }]\n```\n\nYou can add axis labels all around (bottom, end, start, top).\n\n```html\n<ids-axis-chart\n  axis-label-bottom=\"Bottom axis label\"\n  axis-label-end=\"End axis label\"\n  axis-label-start=\"Start axis label\"\n  axis-label-top=\"Top axis label\"\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  id=\"axis-label-example\"\n  title=\"A axis chart showing component usage with axis-label\"\n></ids-axis-chart>\n```\n\nShowing component as horizontal orientation.\n\n```html\n<ids-axis-chart\n  horizontal\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  id=\"axis-horizontal-example\"\n  title=\"Horizontal example\"\n></ids-axis-chart>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsAxisChart\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n  IdsChartLegendMixin\n  IdsChartSelectionMixin\n\n## Data Settings\n\nThe following data attributes can be used on the data passed to a chart.\n\n- `data` {object} A data group with one or more `name` and `value` pairs.\n- `name` {string} The name for the legend text and tooltip representing the slice.\n- `shortName` {string} The short name of the legend text.\n- `abbrName` {string} A very short name of the legend text (one or two characters).\n- `color` {string} The color of this axis group. This can be either a hex value for example `#FF0000` or a color name like `red` or an ids variable like `var(--ids-color-azure-20)`.\n- `tooltip` {string} The custom tooltip string (as static text). See the tooltip section for more information.\n\n## Settings\n\n- `title` {string} Sets the internal title of the chart (for accessibility). It is recommended to mention the chart type for accessibility readout. For example: `Line chart showing invoice history`.\n- `height` {number} Generally this is calculated automatically but can be used to set a specific height.\n- `width` {number} Generally this is calculated automatically but can be used to set a specific width.\n- `textWidths` {object} Generally this is calculated automatically but can be overridden by setting the amount of space to allocate for margins on the `{ left, right, top, bottom }` sides.\n- `textWidths` {object} Generally this is calculated automatically but can be overridden by setting the amount of space to allocate for text on the `{ left, right, top, bottom }` sides.\n- `xAxisMin` {number}  Set the minimum value on the x axis  (default: 0)\n- `yAxisMin` {number}  Set the minimum value on the y axis  (default: 0)\n- `showVerticalGridLines` {boolean}  Show the vertical axis grid lines (default: false)\n- `showHorizontalGridLines` {boolean}  Show the horizontal axis grid lines (default: true)\n- `yAxisFormatter` {object | Function} Sets the format on the y axis items. This can either be settings that are passed to `Intl.NumberFormat` or a formatter function. The formatter function will get three parameters (value, data, api) and should return a string based on the axis value. The y axis is not always a number so it does not default to `Intl.NumberFormat`. The default is `{ notation: 'compact', compactDisplay: 'short' }`.\n- `xAxisFormatter` {Function} Sets the format on the x axis items. The formatter function will get three parameters (value, data, api) and should return a string based on the axis value. The x axis is not always a number so it does not default to `Intl.NumberFormat`. See the [Intl.NumberFormat api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) for more details and examples on formatting options.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} Flips the orientation to horizontal, supported `Axis` and `Bar` type charts.\n- `selectable` {boolean} Sets the selection mode.\n- `axisLabelBottom` {string} Option to add bottom axis label.\n- `axisLabelEnd` {string} Option to add horizontally end side axis label.\n- `axisLabelStart` {string} Option to add horizontally start side axis label.\n- `axisLabelTop` {string} Option to add top axis label.\n- `axisLabelMargin` {string|number} Axis label margin value.\n- `rotateNameLabels` {string|number} Sets the rotation of the labels on the name axis (style guide recommends -60 but you may want to tweak it based on labels. The `shortName` and `abbreviatedName` labels do not work with this setting.\n\n## Events\n\n- `rendered` Fires each time the chart is rendered or rerendered (on resize).\n- `beforeselected` Fires before selected, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `selected` Fires after selected.\n- `beforedeselected` Fires before deselected, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `deselected` Fires after deselected.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` the outer container div element\n- `chart` the svg outer element\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Theme\n- Legends\n- Selectable\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Sizes to the given width/height defaulting to that of the immediate parent.\n\n## Tooltip Customizations\n\nYou can customize the tooltip by changing some of the API settings. For just a static tooltip you can use the `tooltip` setting in the data at the same place as the `name` property.\n\nIf you need to change which items get tooltips you can override `tooltipElements` getter.\n\n```js\ntooltipElements() {\n  return this.container.querySelectorAll('rect.bar');\n}\n\nIf you need to change the tooltip contents you can override the `tooltipTemplate` function.\n\n```js\ntooltipTemplate() {\n  return '<b>${label}</b> ${value}';\n}\n```\n\nOr you can modify the tooltip in the slot.\n\n## Why Not Canvas?\n\nWe decided to use SVG over Canvas because of the following reasons:\n\n- Canvas is not part of the DOM thus not accessible by screen readers.\n- Canvas is more difficult to make interactive and responsive.\n- Would be generally more maintainable.\n- SVG output is easier to debug.\n"

Often Line charts convey a series of data over periods over time. Line charts can use both single and multiple variables to emphasize trends over several series. Users can interact by clicking or tapping on chart lines to focus on a certain series of data on a line chart. And users can also interact by hovering data points to reveal additional information in a tooltip.\n\nFor more information on line charts check out the article [Line Charts Made Simple](https://uxdesign.cc/line-chart-design-made-simple-a1b823510674).\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Use when you want to show change over time.\n- Use when you want to show trends.\n- Use when you want to show comparison of change for several groups.\n- Use when you want to aid prediction.\n\n## Usage Considerations\n\n- Do not show too many lines at once as it may be difficult to interpret.

In smaller breakpoints the abbreviated name(s) will be shown.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- The line chart was added after version 3.6 so new in 4.x and had a new way to invoke it.\n\n**5.x to 5.x**\n- Line Chart now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- Now called IdsAccordion with a namespace\n- The data object is the same format except for two changes.\n  - `shortName` is now `shortName`\n  - `abbreviatedName` is now `abbrName`\n- If using side by side the old line chart requires the height and width of the parent to be visible. So you may need to toggle the visibility of `ids-container` or some new element if its nested in it.\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs 4.5](https://www.figma.com/file/yaJ8mJrqRRej8oTsd6iT8P/IDS-(SoHo)-Component-Library-v4.5?node-id=760%3A771)\n[Design Specs 4.6](https://www.figma.com/file/ok0LLOT9PP1J0kBkPMaZ5c/IDS_Component_File_v4.6-(Draft))\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nChart labels should be localized in the current language.

It can be round or rounded rectangle.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `badge` allows you to further style the badge element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal/ no properties badge used as a web component.\n\n```html\n<ids-badge>5</ids-badge>\n```\n\nA colored badge is done by adding a `color` attribute and one of the following:\nalert, error, info, warning, and success.\n\n```html\n<ids-badge color=\"alert\">10</ids-badge>\n<ids-badge color=\"error\">1500</ids-badge>\n<ids-badge color=\"info\">25k+</ids-badge>\n<ids-badge color=\"warning\">16</ids-badge>\n<ids-badge color=\"success\">5</ids-badge>\n```\n\nA shape badge is done by adding a `shape` attribute and one of the following: normal, and round. When you don't set the shape, normal will be the default value.\n\n```html\n<ids-badge color=\"alert\" shape=\"round\">10</ids-badge>\n```\n\nA badge with an icon can be configure by adding the `<ids-icon></ids-icon>` component inside of the badge.\n\n```html\n<ids-badge color=\"alert\" shape=\"round\"><ids-icon icon=\"pending\" size=\"normal\"></ids-icon></ids-badge>\n```\n\nAudible span can de configure by adding `<ids-text audible=\"true\"></ids-text>` inside of the badge.\n\n```html\n<ids-badge color=\"error\">404 <ids-text audible=\"true\">In Error Condition</ids-text></ids-badge>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `color` {string} Sets the color of the badge e.g. `alert`, `error`, or `info`.\n- `shape` {string} `normal` is the default value of the shape, you can also change it to `round`.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Color\n- Shape\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nBadges do not have tab stops and have no keyboard interaction on their own, but they may be placed in a grid cell or object that has tab focus.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 Ensure the color badges pass contrast.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-badge></ids-badge>\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The names of some badge types have changed.\n- The yellow warning is removed in favor of just the orange warning.\n- Some of the types/settings are changed.\n"

Users can interact by clicking or tapping on bars to drill in on a certain series of data. Users can also interact by hovering bars to reveal additional information in a tooltip. The x-axis could be any variable, such as time, or the category that is being measured.\n\nGrouped bar graphs, also called clustered bar graphs, represent discrete values for more than one item that share the same category. For example a grouped bar graph could display several categories within each main category such as male and female, within certain traits on the x-axis. To make a grouped bar chart provide the appropriately formatted data.\n\nStacked bar graphs or composite bar graphs divide an aggregate total into parts. Each segment adds to the total of the bar and are separated by different colors. To make a stacked bar chart use `stacked=\"true\"` and provide the appropriately formatted data.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Display an earnings per share (EPS)\n- Compare revenue or cash flow over time\n- Compares series through a visual representation of data in columns.\n- Quickly compares trends in a variety of ways\n\n## Usage Considerations\n\n- Do not show too many bars or too many categories or segments or the data may be hard to read.\n- Hover tooltips should only be used to reveal additional non-critical information.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Bar**: The UI element that represents a concrete value in a color.\n- **Category**: The section for each bar when grouping.\n- **Segment**: The section for each bar value when stacking\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nAn bar chart is defined with the custom element and width and height.\n\n```html\n  <ids-bar-chart title=\"A bar chart showing component usage\" show-vertical-grid-lines=\"true\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" id=\"index-example\"></ids-bar-chart>\n```\n\nDatasets can be added to the bar chart by passing in an array of objects. Each object must have a `data` and object with `name` and `values` to form the data points. Also a name should be given for each data object which will be used as the legend text. The `shortName` is used to show the short name of the legend text and the `abbrName` is used to show an even shorter name of the legend text in responsive situations.\n\n```js\nconst dataset = [{\n  data: [{\n    name: 'Jan',\n    value: 1\n  }, {\n    name: 'Feb',\n    value: 2\n  }, {\n    name: 'Mar',\n    value: 3\n  }, {\n    name: 'Apr',\n    value: 5\n  }, {\n    name: 'May',\n    value: 7\n  }, {\n    name: 'Jun',\n    value: 10\n  }],\n  name: 'Component A',\n  shortName: 'Comp A',\n  abbrName: 'A',\n}];\n\ndocument.querySelector('ids-bar-chart').data = dataset;\n```\n\nA chart can also be `stacked` or `grouped`. Stacked bar graphs or composite bar graphs divide an aggregate total into parts. Each segment adds to the total of the bar and are separated by different colors.\n\nTo make a stacked bar chart use `stacked=\"true\"` and provide the appropriately formatted data.\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsBarChart\n  - IdsAxisChart\n    - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsEventsMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n\n## Data Settings\n\n(See  Axis Chart Settings for more information)\n\n## Settings\n\n- `barPercentage` {number} A percent (0-1) of the available width each bar should be within the category width. 1.0 will take the whole category width and put the bars right next to each other. In a grouped chart the barPercentage value, will use as whole category percentage. We change the defaults depending on stacked or grouped bar charts but this can be adjusted to change the bar sizes.\n- `categoryPercentage` {number} Percent (0-1) of the available width for each category section. We change the defaults depending on stacked or grouped bar charts.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} Flips the orientation to horizontal.\n\nThe following shows the relationship between the bar percentage option and the category percentage option.\n\n```sh\n// categoryPercentage: 1.0\n// barPercentage: 1.0\nBar:        | 1.0 | 1.0 |\nCategory:   |    1.0    |\nSection:    |===========|\n\n// categoryPercentage: 1.0\n// barPercentage: 0.5\nBar:          |.5|  |.5|\nCategory:  |      1.0     |\nSection:   |==============|\n\n// categoryPercentage: 0.5\n// barPercentage: 1.0\nBar:             |1.0||1.0|\nCategory:        |   .5   |\nSection:    |==================|\n```\n\n- `stacked` {boolean} Set to true to make a stacked bar chart.\n- `grouped` {boolean} Set to true to make a grouped bar chart.\n\n(See Axis Chart Settings for other shared settings)\n\n## Patterns\n\nThe bar chart includes patterns that can be used for color blind users. We plan on adding this to other charts as well.\nTo use a pattern specify it on the `pattern` attribute it in the data. You can also set a `patternColor` otherwise it will use the default color for that item in the series.\n\n```js\nconst data = [{\n  data: [{\n    name: 'Jan',\n    value: 1\n  }, {\n    name: 'Feb',\n    value: 2\n  }],\n  name: 'Component A',\n  pattern: 'circles',\n  patternColor: '#DA1217'\n}];\n```\n\nThe following patterns are supported:\n\n```sh\narrows\nboxes\ncheckers\npatches\ncircles\nexes\ndiamonds\ndots\nstars\nmixed\nsquares\nhex\nbig-hex\nintersect\nlines\nbars\npipes\nmesh\npluses\nwaves\nbig-waves\n```\n\nShowing component as horizontal orientation.\n\n```html\n<ids-bar-chart\n  horizontal\n  width=\"700\"\n  height=\"400\"\n  id=\"bar-horizontal-example\"\n  title=\"Horizontal example\"\n></ids-bar-chart>\n```\n\n## Events\n\n(See Axis Chart Settings for more information)\n\n## Methods\n\n(See Axis Chart Settings for more information)\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `svg` the outside svg element\n- `bar` each bar element  in the chart\n- `lines` each line element in the chart\n\n## Animation\n\nThe bars rise along the y-axis from 0 to the appropriate values.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n(See Line Chart and Axis Chart Settings for more information)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n(See Line Chart and Axis Chart Settings for more information)\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The area chart will fill the size of its parent container and readjust when the window is resized.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n- 4.x: The area chart was added after version 3.6 so new in 4.x\n- 5.x: Bar Chart have all new markup and classes for web components but the data is still the same except for a few changes.\n  - `shortName` is now `shortName`\n  - `abbreviatedName` is now `abbrName`\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information.\n- Approach is to treat the bar items as a list `role=\"list\"`. The bar items are `role=\"listitem\"`. The tab index is not visible to the user as it is not needed and can be navigated with a screen reader.\n- Using voice over the sequence is to\n  - Navigate to the parent element above it  or parent page\n  - Hold <kbd>caps lock + left/right arrow</kbd>\n  - You will hear the title , followed by number of items and then each list item\n  - Proceed to use <kbd>caps lock + left/right arrow</kbd> will move through the list items announcing the values\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nChart labels should be localized in the current language. The chart will flip in RTL mode. For some color blind users the svg patterns can be used.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Checkbox Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe IDS Checkbox component is a simple wrapper around a standard HTMLInputElement that is styled with Infor branding, and contains some additional API that makes it easy to set checkbox, label, and functionality. Checkboxes can also be grouped with a label.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Checkboxes are particularly useful in allowing users to make choices on lists of selectable options. In contrast with radio buttons, which are included in lists where options are mutually exclusive, checkboxes allow users to toggle multiple responses to “on” and “off” states.\n- Create checkbox, each with different styling to provide context for actions that are checked, unchecked, indeterminate, value, disabled and colored.\n- Checkboxes allow users to make zero, one, or multiple selections in a list with multiple items.\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Checkbox**: A standard basic checkbox element. It can set to checked, unchecked, indeterminate and disabled. IDS checkbox will add `aria-required` for required elements.\n**Label**: HTMLLabelElement to keep matching with HTMLInputElement. Make sure the label has a meaningful relative. IDS Checkbox will add sudo ui `*` for required elements.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `label` allows you to further style the label element\n- `input` allows you to further style the checkbox input element\n- `label-text` allows you to further style the text element in the label\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nA standard Checkbox unchecked element:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Unchecked\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet as Checked, the checkbox.\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Checked\" checked=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet the Dirty Tracking to Checkbox this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Dirty tracking\" dirty-tracker=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet the Hitbox to Checkbox this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Checkbox with Hitbox\" hitbox=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nAdd an Disabled Checkbox as unchecked:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Disabled and unchecked\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nAdd an Disabled Checkbox as checked:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Disabled and checked\" checked=\"true\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Checkbox this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Required\" validate=\"required\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Checkbox without label required indicator:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Required (No indicator)\" label-required=\"false\" validate=\"required\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nAdd an Colored checked:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox checked=\"true\" color=\"emerald\" label=\"Emerald\"></ids-checkbox>\n<ids-checkbox checked=\"true\" color=\"caution\" label=\"Caution\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nSet as Indeterminate the checkbox. This `indeterminate` attribute will remove on every time checkbox `change` it's state `checked/unchecked`, so it must be added every time it need to set.\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Indeterminate\" indeterminate=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\nHide label and show only checkbox:\n\n```html\n<ids-checkbox label=\"UnChecked\" label-state=\"hidden\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `checked` {boolean} set checked state.\n- `color` {string} set the color for checkbox.\n- `dirty-tracker` {boolean} set dirty tracker.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} set checkbox layout inline as horizontal.\n- `indeterminate` {boolean} This set to neither checked nor unchecked.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `label-state` {string} sets the checkbox label state -- can be `hidden`, or omitted.\n- `label-required` {boolean} set validation `required` indicator, default is set to `true`.\n- `validate` {string} set the validation rule `required`.\n- `validation-events` {string} set the validation events, use `space` to add multiple default is set to `change`.\n- `value` {string} set the checkbox value.\n- `noAnimation` {boolean} disable the checkbox animation\n\n## Events\n\n- `change` The change event is fired when a checkbox element's value is committed by the user. Unlike the input event, the change event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's value.\n- `input` The input event fires when the value of a checkbox element has been changed.\n\n## States\n\n- disabled\n- dirty\n- validation/error\n- focused\n- active\n- unchecked/checked/partially selected\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Checkbox doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLInputElement:\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the edit field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> toggle the checked/unchecked state.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default display set as `block`, but can change to `inline-block` by use of `horizontal` attribute as `true`.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Wrap the input in an element with the class field\n- Change class `inforCheckbox` to checkbox\n- Change class `inforCheckboxLabel` to checkbox-label\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-checkbox></ids-checkbox>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events (change/input ect)\n- Can now use the hitbox styles by adding the setting to the ids-checkbox component\n\nThe IDS Checkbox component is now a WebComponent. Instead of using classes to define, it is done directly:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x checkbox example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n  <input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox1\" id=\"checkbox1\"/>\n  <label for=\"checkbox1\" class=\"checkbox-label\">Unchecked</label>\n</div>\n\n<!-- this is the same checkbox using the web component version -->\n<ids-checkbox label=\"Unchecked\"></ids-checkbox>\n```\n"

        "value": "# Ids Card Component\n\n## Description\n\nA card is a UI design pattern that groups related information in a flexible-size container visually resembling a playing card. Cards are also known as widgets when used in a home page tile layout. The card's actions in the toolbar should depend on what is inside the card.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Cards are good for grouping information, for example in a homepage dashboard layout\n- Cards allow for flexible layout, and can be used in smaller and larger sizes.\n- Cards contain various forms of content and actions. Elements like input texts, images, charts, can be displayed inside a card.\n\n## Dos and Don'ts\n\n- Don't use a card on a popup like a modal or a contextual action panel. The popup itself should be able to stand alone.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Card**: UI design pattern that groups related information that resembles a card\n- **Widget**: Card and widget are sometimes used interchangeably.\n- **Group Action**: A special toolbar inside the card content area that can be used to act on the content.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `card` allows you to further style the main card element\n- `header` allows you to further style the card header element\n- `content` allows you to further style the card content element\n- `footer` allows you to further style the card footer element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA card is created by using the custom `ids-card` element. A card has two content slots, one for the header area which usually contains title and a small number of action buttons. The card content area can contain whatever content you like. This content should be responsive.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card can be an actionable with the behavior of a button.\n\n```html\n<ids-card actionable=\"true\">\n  <div slot=\"actionable-text\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"p\">Actionable Button Card</ids-text>\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card with footer element.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-footer\">\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card with footer element and vertical no-padding.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-footer\" no-padding>\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `autoHeight` {boolean} Makes the card the same height as its inner content\n- `actionable` {boolean} It will make the card act as a button\n- `height` {number} It will make the card have a fixed height (used primarily on actionable cards)\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Group Action\n- Sizes\n- Hover\n- Disabled\n- Focus\n- Pressed/Active/Selected\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the card has focusable elements, tab will toggle through them in the general form order. If the header contains a toolbar. Arrow keys should be used between buttons on the toolbars\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Depending on the container in the responsive grid, the width of the card follows the layout of the grid. However, when using in a home page a special algorithm is used to both keep the tab order and fill in the gaps most efficiently depending on the card dimensions.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Cards have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-card></ids-card>` and has slots for the header and body content\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n- The Card/Widget component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-card.\n- The expandable card feature is deprecated\n"

It gives a way of evenly split contents of a list within a grid.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nUse when you wanted to create rows of images with paragraphs/links that need to stay evenly spaced.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Align**: The position of the block grid. You can set it to be center, left, or right.\n\n## Feature (With the Code Examples)\n\nA block grid is created by using the `ids-block-grid` as the main container, and `ids-block-grid-item` for the item inside of it.\n\n```html\n<ids-block-grid>\n  <ids-blockgrid-item>\n    Content Here...\n  </ids-blockgrid-item>\n</ids-block-grid>\n```\n\nYou can set the alignment of the block grid by setting the `align` property with these three options `left`, `centered` or `right`. By default, the position is set to `centered` align.\n\n```html\n<ids-block-grid align=\"centered\">\n  <ids-blockgrid-item>\n    Content Here...\n  </ids-blockgrid-item>\n</ids-block-grid>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `align` {string} Sets the position of the block grid and it's contents.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Align\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The block grid uses flex container to be able to fill available free space and shrinks them to prevent overflow, while the block grid item has a width of 200px. It automatically sets the height depends on how many the block grid item is.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe use of this component is not recommended for Accessibility since the lack of elements in the page may pose issues for screen reader and other assistive technology. Consider a way to disable this functionality.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- New Component in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Block Grid now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- The way paging and selection are applied have changes to the api\n"

It gives a way of evenly split contents of a list within a grid.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nUse when you wanted to create rows of images with paragraphs/links that need to stay evenly spaced.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Align**: The position of the block grid. You can set it to be center, left, or right.\n\n## Feature (With the Code Examples)\n\nA block grid is created by using the `ids-block-grid` as the main container, and `ids-block-grid-item` for the item inside of it.\n\n```html\n<ids-block-grid>\n  <ids-blockgrid-item>\n    Content Here...\n  </ids-blockgrid-item>\n</ids-block-grid>\n```\n\nYou can set the alignment of the block grid by setting the `align` property with these three options `left`, `centered` or `right`. By default, the position is set to `centered` align.\n\n```html\n<ids-block-grid align=\"centered\">\n  <ids-blockgrid-item>\n    Content Here...\n  </ids-blockgrid-item>\n</ids-block-grid>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `align` {string} Sets the position of the block grid and it's contents.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Align\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The block grid uses flex container to be able to fill available free space and shrinks them to prevent overflow, while the block grid item has a width of 200px. It automatically sets the height depends on how many the block grid item is.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe use of this component is not recommended for Accessibility since the lack of elements in the page may pose issues for screen reader and other assistive technology. Consider a way to disable this functionality.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- New Component in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Block Grid now uses all new markup and classes for web components (see above)\n- The way paging and selection are applied have changes to the api\n"

It is best for presenting hierarchical paths in a system and showing the user the location.\n\nBreadcrumbs show the user's location within the context of a site’s navigational hierarchy. Since it only displays the navigational path from a single point of origin, it does not reflect the user's previous site history. While multi-line breadcrumbs are supported and sometimes necessary, truncated or single-line breadcrumbs are preferred, as they are less content-dense.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Breadcrumbs give users a way to view and trace their steps back through various levels within a hierarchy. Breadcrumbs help to minimize confusion in applications that contain a deep navigational hierarchy.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal breadcrumb component with an disabled item. The last item is considered the current link and has bolded styling.\n\n```html\n<ids-breadcrumb>\n  <ids-hyperlink font-size=\"14\" color=\"unset\">First Item</ids-hyperlink>\n  <ids-hyperlink font-size=\"14\" color=\"unset\">Second Item</ids-hyperlink>\n  <ids-hyperlink font-size=\"14\" color=\"unset\" disabled>Disabled Item</ids-hyperlink>\n  <ids-hyperlink font-size=\"14\" color=\"unset\">Current Item</ids-hyperlink>\n</ids-breadcrumb>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\nInside the breadcrumb you can have either ids-text of ids-hyperlink elements depending if the text is linkable or not.\n\nThe following ids-hyperlink attributes should be considered\n\n- `color` {string} Set to unset to disable the hyperlink color and get the default coloring to work.\n- `disabled` Use leave blank or set to 'true' to set disabled color.\n- `font-size` {number} Will be 14 by default.\n- `href` {string} The url that the hyperlink component links to.\n- `truncate` {boolean} true if the breadcrumb list can become \"truncated\", hiding some links behind an overflow menu\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Default: The default state of breadcrumb text.\n- Hover: Indicates that the user is hovering over a text item in the breadcrumb, and can click on the item to navigate to a level that is higher in the navigational hierarchy. Since the last item in the breadcrumb represents the user’s current page, it is typically non-interactive and does not include a hover state.\n- Focus: Indicates that the user has highlighted the hyperlink through tab key navigation.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `checkbox` allows you to further style the checkbox input element\n- `slider` allows you to further style the sliding part of the switch\n- `label` allows you to further style the label text\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the bread crumb item is focus is focusable this will focus or unfocus the link.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: If a link this will follow the link.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- \"Collapsing Lists\" was deprecated but later added as truncate feature.\n- Markup has entirely changed, see the updated code example\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-breadcrumb></ids-breadcrumb>`\n- Markup Uses `ids-hyperlink` instead of `<a>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n"

The default version consists of 4 slots. `header`, `pane`, `expander-default` and `expander-expanded`.\n- **header**: Usually contains an `ids-text` component and displays the title of the expandable area. When type is set to `toggle-btn` the header will container an `ids-toggle-button` and acts as the control for expanding and collapsing.\n- **pane**: This slot contains the content for the expandable area. Usually contains an `ids-text` component but can be filled with anything within reason, such as, forms.\n- **expander-default**: Acts as the control for expanding. Contains the text for the collapsed state.\n- **expander-expanded**: Acts as the control for collapsing. Contains the text for the expanded state.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` allows you to further style the main container element\n- `header` allows you to further style the header element\n- `pane` allows you to further style the pane element\n- `pane-content` allows you to further style the content pane\n- `footer` allows you to further style the footer element\n\n## Events\n\n- `beforeexpand` Vetoable event triggered before expanding pane\n- `beforecollapse` Vetoable event triggered before collapsing pane\n- `expand` Triggered when pane starts expanding\n- `collapse` Triggered when pane starts collapsing\n- `afterexpand` Triggered after expand css transition\n- `aftercollapse` Triggered after collapse css transition\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nIds Expandable Area - Default\n\n```html\n<ids-expandable-area>\n    <ids-text slot=\"header\" font-size=\"16\">Procurement</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"pane\" font-size=\"14\">\n        Ubiquitous out-of-the-box, scalable; communities disintermediate beta-test, enable utilize markets dynamic\n        infomediaries virtual data-driven synergistic aggregate infrastructures, \"cross-platform, feeds\n        bleeding-edge tagclouds.\" Platforms extend interactive B2C benchmark proactive, embrace e-markets,\n        transition generate peer-to-peer.\n    </ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"expander-default\" font-size=\"14\">Show More</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"expander-expanded\" font-size=\"14\">Show Less</ids-text>\n</ids-expandable-area>\n```\n\nIds Expandable Area - Toggle Button\n\n```html\n<ids-expandable-area type=\"toggle-btn\">\n    <ids-toggle-button\n        slot=\"header\"\n        id=\"test-toggle-button\"\n        icon-on=\"caret-up\"\n        icon-off=\"caret-down\"\n        text-off=\"Employee\"\n        text-on=\"Employee\"\n    >\n        <span></span>\n        <ids-icon icon=\"settings\"></ids-icon>\n    </ids-toggle-button>\n    <ids-text slot=\"pane\" font-size=\"14\">\n        Ubiquitous out-of-the-box, scalable; communities disintermediate beta-test, enable utilize markets dynamic\n        infomediaries virtual data-driven synergistic aggregate infrastructures, \"cross-platform, feeds\n        bleeding-edge tagclouds.\" Platforms extend interactive B2C benchmark proactive, embrace e-markets,\n        transition generate peer-to-peer.\n    </ids-text>\n</ids-expandable-area>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- **Collapsed**: The state where the expandable area’s content is not visible. Sometimes it serves as the default state, this state can also be remembered by the application.\n- **Expanded**: The state where the expandable area’s content is visible. Sometimes it serves as the default state, this state can also be remembered by the application.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Enter or Space**: When focus is on an `expander`, this keystroke toggles the expansion of the corresponding expandable area panel. If collapsed, the panel is expanded, and its aria-expanded state is set to true. If expanded, the panel is collapsed and its aria-expanded state is set to false.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Expandable Area and Field Set were separated\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The ExpandableArea component has been changed to a web component and renamed to `<ids-expandable-area>`.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-expandable-area` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The settings are changed and uses flexible slots\n- The events now use native events / custom events\n"

        "value": "# Ids Dropdown Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Ids Dropdown allows users to select one of many options from a list, similar to using an HTML Select Element, with additional selection and filtering features. The dropdown displays one or more selectable values in a menu that is collapsed by default. A user can select an actionable value.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Use when you need to let the user select something from a list of values\n- Use when you want users to contribute data to your website and let them organize their content themselves.\n- Best used when users do not require a view of all possible values at all times.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Dropdown** The UX element that lives in the page and is actionable, activating the list\n- **Dropdown List** The UX element that contains and places the list within the page\n- **List Box**: The UX element that wraps the items in the dropdown\n- **List Box Option**: UX elements representing dropdown options, contained by the List Box\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nDropdown elements should be defined with `id` and `value` attributes. The value should match one of the `value` attributes contained by one of its `ids-list-box-option` elements.  When your application renders, the referenced value will cause the corresponding `ids-list-box-option` to appear selected:\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-2\" label=\"Readonly Dropdown\" value=\"opt3\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1\" id=\"opt1\">Option One</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2\" id=\"opt2\">Option Two</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt3\" id=\"opt3\">Option Three</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt4\" id=\"opt4\">Option Four</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt5\" id=\"opt5\">Option Five</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt6\" id=\"opt6\">Option Six</ids-list-box-option>\n  </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to show icons in the dropdown list. Add an `ids-icon` and `span` to each list box `ids-list-box-option`. For symmetry, icons should be on all options.\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-5\" label=\"Dropdown with Icons\" value=\"opt2\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1\" id=\"opt1\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"user-profile\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option One</span>\n    </ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2\" id=\"opt2\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"project\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option Two</span>\n    </ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt3\" id=\"opt3\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"purchasing\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option Three</span>\n    </ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt4\" id=\"opt4\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"quality\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option Four</span></ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt5\" id=\"opt5\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"rocket\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option Five</span>\n    </ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt6\" id=\"opt6\">\n      <ids-icon icon=\"roles\"></ids-icon>\n      <span>Option Six</span>\n    </ids-list-box-option>\n  </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown>\n```\n\nIts also possible to show tooltips on the dropdown container or dropdown options. If you set it on the `ids-dropdown` you will see the tooltip on hover of the closed dropdown. If you set it on the options, when these are selected it will change the container tooltip to the selected one.\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-6\" label=\"Dropdown with Tooltips\" tooltip=\"Additional Info\" value=\"opt2\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1\" id=\"opt1\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option One\">Option One</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2\" id=\"opt2\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option Two\">Option Two</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt3\" id=\"opt3\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option Three\">Option Three</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt4\" id=\"opt4\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option Four\">Option Four</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt5\" id=\"opt5\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option Five\">Option Five</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt6\" id=\"opt6\" tooltip=\"Additional Info on Option Six\">Option Six</ids-list-box-option>\n  </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown>\n```\n\nSometimes you might want to load the dropdown with Ajax. To do this setup the initial html. in order for the selected element to show. This must be pre-populated.\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-7\" label=\"Dropdown Using Ajax\" value=\"ak\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"ak\" id=\"ak\">Alaska</ids-list-box-option>\n </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown>\n```\n\nFor the JS part set the `beforeShow` callback to an async function that returns a promise.\n\n```js\n// Use the asynchronous `beforeshow` callback to load contents\nconst dropdownAsync = document.querySelector('#dropdown-7');\n\ndropdownAsync.beforeShow = async function beforeShow() {\n  const url = '/data/states.json';\n  const res = await fetch(url);\n  const data = await res.json();\n  return data;\n};\n```\n\nThe promise should resolve and return data with id, value and label info.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"id\": \"AS\",\n  \"value\": \"AS\",\n  \"label\": \"American Samoa\"\n}\n```\n\nFor groups you should add `group-label` attribute to `ids-list-box-option` to indicate group start, all group items should be below.\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-groups\" label=\"Dropdown With Groups\" value=\"opt3\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option group-label>Group 1</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1group1\">Option One</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2group1\">Option Two</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option group-label>Group 2</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1group2\">Option One</ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2group2\">Option Two</ids-list-box-option>\n  </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown>\n```\n\nIn some situations, it may be preferrable to separate the IdsDropdownList element from its in-page parent element.  This can be done using the `list` attribute, and simply referencing the dropdown list by its `id` attribute.  This might be necessary for reasons such as breaking out of CSS stacking context.  Note that in this situation, it's necessary to also manually define the event handling and [Popup Interactions](../../mixins/ids-popup-interactions-mixin/ids-popup-interactions-mixin.ts) that cause the IdsDropdownList to activate, making this ideal for custom IdsDropdown configurations:\n\n```html\n<ids-dropdown id=\"dropdown-1\" list=\"separate-list\" label=\"Dropdown (list is adjacent)\" value=\"blank\" dirty-tracker=\"true\" allow-blank=\"true\"></ids-dropdown>\n<ids-dropdown-list id=\"separate-list\">\n  <ids-list-box>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"blank\" id=\"blank\"><span></span></ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt1\" id=\"opt1-d8\"><span>Option One</span></ids-list-box-option>\n    <ids-list-box-option value=\"opt2\" id=\"opt2-d8\"><span>Option Two</span></ids-list-box-option>\n  </ids-list-box>\n</ids-dropdown-list>\n```\n\n## Settings\n\n- `allowBlank` {boolean} Sets whether option list should include 'blank' option\n- `colorVariant` {string} set the current color variant.\n- `compact` {boolean} sets the component to be compact mode.\n- `dirtyTracker` {boolean} Sets the dirty tracking feature on to indicate a changed\n- `disabled` {boolean} Sets dropdown to disabled\n- `fieldHeight` {string} defines the field height. See [Ids Field Height Mixin](../../mixins/ids-field-height-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `label` {string} Sets the label text\n- `language` {string} Sets the language for RTL and inner labels\n- `labelRequired` {boolean} Sets the validation required indicator on label text, it's default to `true`\n- `labelState` {string} indicates that a label is hidden (note that for accessibility reasons, `label` should still be specified). See [Ids Label State Mixin](../../mixins/ids-label-state-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `list` {string} ID selector used to reference/connect to an external IdsDropdownList component (used in some scenarios like IdsDataGrid filters)\n- `maxlength` {number | string} Maximum characters allowed in textarea\n- `noMargins` {boolean} sets whether or not no-margins around the component.\n- `placeholder` {string} Sets the placeholder text\n- `size` {'sm ' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'full' | string} Sets the size (width)\n- `readonly` {boolean} Sets to readonly state\n- `validate` {'required' | string} Sets the validation routine to use\n- `validationEvents` {'blur' | string} Sets the validation events to use\n- `value` {string} Sets option to the matching option by the `value` attribute\n- `id` {string} Sets the `id` attribute\n- `tooltip` {string} Sets the tooltip on the dropdown container\n- `mode` {'light' | 'dark' | 'contrast' | string} Set the theme mode\n- `version` {'new' | 'classic' | string} Set the theme version\n- `selectedIndex` {number} Sets the the selected option by index\n- `typeahead` {true | false} - Enable/disable typeahead functionality\n- `clearable` {true | false} - Whether or not the value can be cleared with Backspace/Delete\n- `clearable-text` {string} - Sets the blank option custom text. The text will not be added to the input when the option is selected\n- `show-loading-indicator` {boolean} - Whether or not to show loading indicator (replaces trigger button). Defaults to false.\n\n## Events\n\n- `change` Fires when an option is selected / changed\n- `focus` Fires at the time the dropdown is focused\n- Event listeners for input (trigger field) `blur`, `change`, `focus`, `select`, `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`, `click`, `dbclick`, `beforetriggerclicked`, `triggerclicked` events can be added to `input` component property:\n```js\nconst dropdown = document.querySelector('ids-dropdown');\n\ndropdown.input.addEventListener('change');\n```\n- Event listeners for popup `show`, `hide` events can be added to `popup` property:\n```js\nconst dropdown = document.querySelector('ids-dropdown');\n\ndropdown.popup.addEventListener('show');\ndropdown.popup.addEventListener('hide');\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n- `beforeShow` {Promise<string>} An async function that fires as the dropdown is opening allowing you to set contents\n- `toggle` {void} Toggles the dropdown list open/closed state\n- `open` {void} Opens the dropdown list\n- `close` {void} Closes the dropdown list\n- `options` {Array<HTMLElement>} Returns the currently available options\n- `selectedOption` {HTMLElement} Returns the selected option DOM element\n- `selectedIndex` {number} Sets the the selected option by index\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `trigger-field` - allows you to further style  the trigger field container\n- `input` - allows you to further style  the input in the trigger field container\n- `trigger-button` - allows you to further style the trigger field button\n- `icon` - allows you to further style the trigger field icon\n- `popup` - allows you to further style the dropdown popup\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Valid/Invalid\n- Required\n- Readonly\n- Open/Closed\n- Disabled\n- Dirty\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift + Tab</kbd>: Moves focus into and out of the dropdown input. If the list is open, this will close the list, selecting the current item, and moving to the next focusable element\n- <kbd>Alt + Down Arrow / Down Arrow</kbd>: Opens the dropdown list and moves focus to the selected option. If nothing is selected, then focus moves to the first option in the list. If the combobox is not editable nothing will happen.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Selects the currently highlighted item in the list, updates the input field, highlights the selected item in the dropdown list, closes the dropdown list, and returns focus to the input field.\n- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: Closes the dropdown list, returns focus to the edit field, and does not change the current selection.\n- <kbd>AnyKey</kbd>: Typing a letter opens the list and filters to the items that start with that letter\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The dropdown `<input>` should size to the parent container and the `<label>` should remain on the top.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Dropdown have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The dropdown component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-editor.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-dropdown></ids-dropdown>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events (change event when changed)\n- API is significantly different\n- No longer uses a select element\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs 4.5](https://www.figma.com/file/yaJ8mJrqRRej8oTsd6iT8P/IDS-(SoHo)-Component-Library-v4.5?node-id=760%3A771)\n[Design Specs 4.6](https://www.figma.com/file/ok0LLOT9PP1J0kBkPMaZ5c/IDS_Component_File_v4.6-(Draft))\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThe dropdown list has been coded to act similar to the [aria readonly combobox](http://whatsock.com/Templates/Comboboxes/Native%20Inputs,%20Editable%20and%20Readonly/index.htm). With some variations due to having to deal with shadowDom.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLabels should be localized in the current language. The dropdown icons will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

See [Ids Label State Mixin](../../mixins/ids-label-state-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `list` {string} ID selector used to reference/connect to an external IdsDropdownList component (used in some scenarios like IdsDataGrid filters)\n- `maxlength` {number | string} Maximum characters allowed in textarea\n- `noMargins` {boolean} sets whether or not no-margins around the component.\n- `placeholder` {string} Sets the placeholder text\n- `size` {'sm ' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'full' | string} Sets the size (width)\n- `readonly` {boolean} Sets to readonly state\n- `validate` {'required' | string} Sets the validation routine to use\n- `validationEvents` {'blur' | string} Sets the validation events to use\n- `value` {string} Sets option to the matching option by the `value` attribute\n- `id` {string} Sets the `id` attribute\n- `tooltip` {string} Sets the tooltip on the dropdown container\n- `mode` {'light' | 'dark' | 'contrast' | string} Set the theme mode\n- `version` {'new' | 'classic' | string} Set the theme version\n- `selectedIndex` {number} Sets the the selected option by index\n- `typeahead` {true | false} - Enable/disable typeahead functionality\n- `clearable` {true | false} - Whether or not the value can be cleared with Backspace/Delete\n- `clearable-text` {string} - Sets the blank option custom text. The text will not be added to the input when the option is selected\n- `show-loading-indicator` {boolean} - Whether or not to show loading indicator (replaces trigger button). Defaults to false.\n\n## Events\n\n- `change` Fires when an option is selected / changed\n- `focus` Fires at the time the dropdown is focused\n- Event listeners for input (trigger field) `blur`, `change`, `focus`, `select`, `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`, `click`, `dbclick`, `beforetriggerclicked`, `triggerclicked` events can be added to `input` component property:\n```js\nconst dropdown = document.querySelector('ids-dropdown');\n\ndropdown.input.addEventListener('change');\n```\n- Event listeners for popup `show`, `hide` events can be added to `popup` property:\n```js\nconst dropdown = document.querySelector('ids-dropdown');\n\ndropdown.popup.addEventListener('show');\ndropdown.popup.addEventListener('hide');\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n- `beforeShow` {Promise<string>} An async function that fires as the dropdown is opening allowing you to set contents\n- `toggle` {void} Toggles the dropdown list open/closed state\n- `open` {void} Opens the dropdown list\n- `close` {void} Closes the dropdown list\n- `options` {Array<HTMLElement>} Returns the currently available options\n- `selectedOption` {HTMLElement} Returns the selected option DOM element\n- `selectedIndex` {number} Sets the the selected option by index\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `trigger-field` - allows you to further style  the trigger field container\n- `input` - allows you to further style  the input in the trigger field container\n- `trigger-button` - allows you to further style the trigger field button\n- `icon` - allows you to further style the trigger field icon\n- `popup` - allows you to further style the dropdown popup\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Valid/Invalid\n- Required\n- Readonly\n- Open/Closed\n- Disabled\n- Dirty\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift + Tab</kbd>: Moves focus into and out of the dropdown input. If the list is open, this will close the list, selecting the current item, and moving to the next focusable element\n- <kbd>Alt + Down Arrow / Down Arrow</kbd>: Opens the dropdown list and moves focus to the selected option. If nothing is selected, then focus moves to the first option in the list. If the combobox is not editable nothing will happen.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Selects the currently highlighted item in the list, updates the input field, highlights the selected item in the dropdown list, closes the dropdown list, and returns focus to the input field.\n- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: Closes the dropdown list, returns focus to the edit field, and does not change the current selection.\n- <kbd>AnyKey</kbd>: Typing a letter opens the list and filters to the items that start with that letter\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The dropdown `<input>` should size to the parent container and the `<label>` should remain on the top.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Dropdown have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The dropdown component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-editor.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-dropdown></ids-dropdown>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events (change event when changed)\n- API is significantly different\n- No longer uses a select element\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs 4.5](https://www.figma.com/file/yaJ8mJrqRRej8oTsd6iT8P/IDS-(SoHo)-Component-Library-v4.5?node-id=760%3A771)\n[Design Specs 4.6](https://www.figma.com/file/ok0LLOT9PP1J0kBkPMaZ5c/IDS_Component_File_v4.6-(Draft))\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThe dropdown list has been coded to act similar to the [aria readonly combobox](http://whatsock.com/Templates/Comboboxes/Native%20Inputs,%20Editable%20and%20Readonly/index.htm). With some variations due to having to deal with shadowDom.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLabels should be localized in the current language. The dropdown icons will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

        "value": "# Ids Time Picker Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe Timepicker Component provides a click/touch user interface for setting a time.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Entering an exact, unrestricted time (allowing any time to be entered, such as 11:39). In this use case, users should be allowed to either type the time values or select them.\n- Entering time intervals (e.g., allowing time entry only in specific set intervals, such as 15 or 30 minutes). In this case, you should either prevent users from manually entering the minute values or automatically correct manual entries to the nearest interval\n- Entering time values only within a specific range of time (such as only enter times within standard business hours). In this case, you should either prevent users from manually entering values or automatically correct manual entries to the nearest valid time\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Timepicker**: A UI element for setting hours, minutes, seconds and periods (am/pm).\n- **Popup**: A window/modal that appears when the timepicker is clicked.\n- **Dropdowns**: Input elements for selecting hours, minutes, seconds and periods (am/pm).\n- **Period**: AM (before noon) and PM (after noon).\n- **Toggle**: Timepicker's popup will be opened if already closed, or closed if already opened.\n- **Disabled**: Timepicker can be disabled so it cannot be followed or clicked.\n- **Readonly**: Timepicker can be set to readonly so it cannot be edited.\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `autoselect` {boolean} Automatically opens the popup on focus.\n- `autoupdate` {boolean} Automatically updates the time string value and hides the \"Set Time\" button.\n- `colorVariant` {string} set the current color variant.\n- `compact` {boolean} sets the component to be compact mode.\n- `dirty-tracker` {boolean} sets the dirty tracking feature on to indicate a changed field. See [Ids Dirty Tracker Mixin](../../mixins/ids-dirty-tracker-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `disabled` {boolean} Disables the timepicker\n- `fieldHeight` {string} defines the field height.

See [Ids Label State Mixin](../../mixins/ids-label-state-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `placeholder` {string} Set the timepicker's placeholder\n- `noMargins` {boolean} sets whether or not no-margins around the component.\n- `size` {'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'full' | string} Sets the size of the input-field's width\n- `embeddable` {boolean} Set whether or not to show only hours/minutes/seconds dropdowns without input\n- `minute-interval` {number} Set minutes dropdown options interval. Default is 5\n- `second-interval` {number} Set seconds dropdown options interval. Default is 5\n- `hours` {number} Set initial value for hours dropdown in the popup or retrieve the dropdown value\n- `minutes` {number} Set initial value for minutes dropdown in the popup or retrieve the dropdown value\n- `seconds` {number} Set initial value for seconds dropdown in the popup or retrieve the dropdown value\n- `period` {number} Set initial value for period dropdown in the popup or retrieve the dropdown value\n- `validate` {'required'|'time'|string} - Input validation rules\n- `validation-events` {string} - Input validation events, `change blur` as default\n- `start-hour` {number} - Set the start of limit hours. Default is 0\n- `end-hour` {number} - Set the end of limit hours. Default is 24\n- `use-current-time` {true|false} - Set whether or not to show current time in the dropdowns\n\n## Events\n- Event listeners for input (trigger field) `blur`, `change`, `focus`, `select`, `keydown`, `keypress`, `keyup`, `click`, `dbclick`, `beforetriggerclicked`, `triggerclicked` events can be added to `input` component property:\n\n```js\nconst timePicker = document.querySelector('ids-time-picker');\n\ntimePicker.input.addEventListener('change');\n```\n- Event listeners for popup `show`, `hide` events can be added to `popup` property:\n```js\nconst timePicker = document.querySelector('ids-time-picker');\n\ntimePicker.popup.addEventListener('show');\ntimePicker.popup.addEventListener('hide');\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n- `open()` Open the timepicker's popup window\n- `close()` Close the timepicker's popup window\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` allowing to style the container of the component\n- `trigger-button` allowing to style the trigger button\n- `icon` allowing to style the icon in the trigger button\n- `input` allowing to style the input element\n- `popup` allowing to style the popup with dropdowns\n- `btn-set` allowing to style the set button in the popup\n- `hours` allowing to style the hours dropdown\n- `minutes` allowing to style the minutes dropdown\n- `seconds` allowing to style the seconds dropdown\n- `period` allowing to style the period dropdown\n\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal timepicker used as a web component.\n\n```html\n<ids-time-picker\n  label=\"12-Hour Time Picker w/ seconds and period (am/pm)\"\n  placeholder=\"Enter your start time\"\n  format=\"hh:mm:ss a\"\n></ids-time-picker>\n```\n\nA `disabled` timepicker and a `readonly` timepicker.\n\n```html\n<ids-time-picker label=\"Disabled Time Picker\" value=\"10:30 AM\" disabled></ids-time-picker>\n\n<ids-time-picker label=\"Readonly Time Picker\" value=\"10:30 AM\" readonly></ids-time-picker>\n```\n\nAn `autoselect` timepicker and an `autoupdate` timepicker.\n\n```html\n<ids-time-picker label=\"Autoselect Time Picker\" value=\"10:30 AM\" autoselect></ids-time-picker>\n\n<ids-time-picker label=\"Autoupdate Time Picker\" value=\"10:30 AM\" autoupdate></ids-time-picker>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to configure the timepicker with a custom time format. This allows the timepicker to be configured in 24-hour/Miliary time and/or with a seconds picker for more accurate time.\n\n```html\n<ids-time-picker\n  label=\"12-Hour Time Picker (w/ seconds)\"\n  format=\"hh:mm:ss\"\n></ids-time-picker>\n\n<ids-time-picker\n  label=\"24-Hour Time Picker\"\n  format=\"HH:mm\"\n></ids-time-picker>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to control the intervals of minutes and seconds available for picking.\n\n```html\n<ids-time-picker\n  label=\"5-minute intervals\"\n  format=\"hh:mm\"\n  minute-interval=\"5\"\n></ids-time-picker>\n\n<ids-time-picker\n  label=\"10-second intervals\"\n  format=\"hh:mm:ss\"\n  second-interval=\"10\"\n></ids-time-picker>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsTimePicker\n    - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n    - IdsEventsMixin\n    - IdsKeyboardMixin\n    - IdsPopupOpenEventsMixin\n    - IdsLocaleMixin\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: Toggles the popup window, if the timepicker is not disabled or readonly.\n- <kbd>Escape</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd>: Close the popup window, if the timepicker is not disabled or readonly.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines (TODO)\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container. Possibly scrolling as needed based on parent dimensions.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Timepicker was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Timepicker can be invoked with `$('#my-element').timepicker()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Listeners for input and popup events should be added to references `input` and `popup` now. See Events section.\n- `disable/readonly/tabbable` are now attributes not methods\n- Timepicker are now custom element `<ids-time-picker></ids-time-picker>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs WC](https://www.figma.com/file/ri2Knf3KchdfdzRAeds0Ab/IDS-Mobility-v4.6?node-id=1%3A5740)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- The Time Picker needs to support both manual time entry (hours, minutes, and, on rare occasions, seconds) as well as some method of selecting from valid entries. Depending on the use case, users may be able to manually enter a time or only select from a restricted set of values.\n\n## Regional Considerations (TODO)\n\nLabels should be localized in the current language. The close and link icons will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

        "value": "# Ids Toggle Button\n\n## Description\n\nThe IDS Toggle Button component is an extension of the standard [IDS Button](../ids-button/README.md) component, which provides some API around \"toggling\" a feature and having a \"pressed\" state, in addition to the IDS Button's standard features.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Create buttons with \"pressed\" and \"unpressed\" states, which represent an action being toggled \"on\" and \"off\".\n\n## Terminology\n\n- Unpressed: an unpressed state is the visual equivalent to turning a feature \"off\".\n- Pressed: a pressed state is the visual equivalent to turning a feature \"on\".\n- Toggle: the action of toggling switches between unpressed and pressed, swapping to the alternate of what is currently set.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nWhile it's possible to manually set the `icon` and `text` attributes of a Toggle Button the same way that a standard IDS Button would be used, the Toggle Button also contains similarly-named attributes that represent their \"on\" (pressed) and \"off\" (unpressed) visual states. Consider the following example:\n\n```html\n<ids-toggle-button id=\"my-toggle\" icon=\"star-outlined\" icon-on=\"star-filled\" icon-off=\"star-outlined\" text-off=\"Toggle Button (Off)\" text-on=\"Toggle Button (On)\"></ids-toggle-button>\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"on\" (pressed) state would be:\n\n- `icon-on=\"star-filled\"`\n- `text-on=\"Toggle Button (On)\"`\n\nThe \"off\" (unpressed) state would be:\n\n- `icon-off=\"star-outlined\"`\n- `text-off=\"Toggle Button (Off)\"`\n\nIn the above example, the default state of the Toggle button will be \"off\", and the content of the `icon-off`/`text-off` properties will populate the standard `icon`/`text` button properties.  To default the button on, simply use the `pressed` attribute:\n\n```html\n<ids-toggle-button id=\"my-toggle\" pressed=\"true\" icon=\"star-filled\" icon-on=\"star-filled\" icon-off=\"star-outlined\" text-off=\"Toggle Button (Off)\" text-on=\"Toggle Button (On)\"></ids-toggle-button>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\nIn addition to having the same states as Buttons, Toggle Buttons can also have:\n\n- Pressed (on)\n- Unpressed (off)\n\n### \"Default\" Appearance\n\nToggle buttons can only be displayed in the \"default\" button appearance\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions\n\n## Designs\n\n## Alternate Designs\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Accessibility - Axe\n1. Visual Regression Test\n1. Repeat Tests in All Supported Browsers\n1. Some of these as test cases from the [WC gold standard](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki#api)\n1. Can be consumed in NG/Vue/React (pull it in standalone/built see it works standalone)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nBe conscious of the layout of content within your buttons when they are present in RTL situations.\n"

Cards are also known as widgets when used in a home page tile layout. The card's actions in the toolbar should depend on what is inside the card.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Cards are good for grouping information, for example in a homepage dashboard layout\n- Cards allow for flexible layout, and can be used in smaller and larger sizes.\n- Cards contain various forms of content and actions. Elements like input texts, images, charts, can be displayed inside a card.\n\n## Dos and Don'ts\n\n- Don't use a card on a popup like a modal or a contextual action panel. The popup itself should be able to stand alone.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Card**: UI design pattern that groups related information that resembles a card\n- **Widget**: Card and widget are sometimes used interchangeably.\n- **Group Action**: A special toolbar inside the card content area that can be used to act on the content.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `card` allows you to further style the main card element\n- `header` allows you to further style the card header element\n- `content` allows you to further style the card content element\n- `footer` allows you to further style the card footer element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA card is created by using the custom `ids-card` element. A card has two content slots, one for the header area which usually contains title and a small number of action buttons. The card content area can contain whatever content you like. This content should be responsive.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card can be an actionable with the behavior of a button.\n\n```html\n<ids-card actionable=\"true\">\n  <div slot=\"actionable-text\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"p\">Actionable Button Card</ids-text>\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card with footer element.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-footer\">\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\nA card with footer element and vertical no-padding.\n\n```html\n<ids-card>\n  <div slot=\"card-header\">\n    <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Card Title One</ids-text>\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-content\">\n  </div>\n  <div slot=\"card-footer\" no-padding>\n  </div>\n</ids-card>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `autoHeight` {boolean} Makes the card the same height as its inner content\n- `actionable` {boolean} It will make the card act as a button\n- `height` {number} It will make the card have a fixed height (used primarily on actionable cards)\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Group Action\n- Sizes\n- Hover\n- Disabled\n- Focus\n- Pressed/Active/Selected\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the card has focusable elements, tab will toggle through them in the general form order. If the header contains a toolbar. Arrow keys should be used between buttons on the toolbars\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Depending on the container in the responsive grid, the width of the card follows the layout of the grid. However, when using in a home page a special algorithm is used to both keep the tab order and fill in the gaps most efficiently depending on the card dimensions.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Cards have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-card></ids-card>` and has slots for the header and body content\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n- The Card/Widget component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-card.\n- The expandable card feature is deprecated\n"

The intended use of this component is to temporarily draw user attention away from a primary workflow to handle a complicated function, eventually returning its result back to the main workflow.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- creating a new shipping order\n- filling out a small form and submitting to a list.\n- searching a table of data, selecting a record, and returning the record to a [trigger field]('../ids-trigger-field/README.md'), similar to what occurs in the [IdsLookup](../ids-lookup/README.md)\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **\"CAP\"** - IDS's old abbreviation for the old name \"Contextual Action Panel\"\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nAction Panels with no content present look similar to [Modals]('../ids-modal/README.md'), presenting just a floating content area over top of the page:\n\n```html\n<ids-action-panel id=\"my-cap\"></ids-action-panel>\n```\n\nOne main difference between the Modal and CAP is the `toolbar` slot, which will be placed where the Modal's title would normally appear, and is styled similarly to [Headers]('../ids-header/README.md).  The contents of this slot should be an [IdsToolbar]('../ids-toolbar/README.md) marked for the `toolbar` slot:\n\n```html\n<ids-action-panel id=\"my-cap\">\n    <ids-toolbar id=\"cap-toolbar\" slot=\"toolbar\">\n        <ids-toolbar-section type=\"title\">\n            <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\">Company Information</ids-text>\n        </ids-toolbar-section>\n\n        <ids-toolbar-section type=\"buttonset\" align=\"end\">\n            <ids-button id=\"btn-save\" icon=\"save\" no-padding>\n                <ids-text font-weight=\"semi-bold\">Save</ids-text>\n            </ids-button>\n            <ids-separator vertical=\"true\"></ids-separator>\n            <ids-button id=\"btn-close\" icon=\"close\" no-padding>\n                <ids-text font-weight=\"semi-bold\">Close</ids-text>\n            </ids-button>\n        </ids-toolbar-section>\n    </ids-toolbar>\n</ids-action-panel>\n```\n\nSimilar to the Modal, any content not marked for a slot will be present inside the main content area of the CAP:\n\n```html\n<ids-action-panel id=\"my-cap\">\n    <form>\n        <ids-dropdown id=\"cap-dd-template\" label=\"Template\" value=\"1\">\n            <ids-list-box>\n                <ids-list-box-option value=\"\">None</ids-list-box-option>\n                <ids-list-box-option value=\"1\" selected>Template #1</ids-list-box-option>\n                <ids-list-box-option value=\"2\">3568</ids-list-box-option>\n            </ids-list-box>\n        </ids-dropdown>\n\n        <ids-textarea id=\"cap-textarea-notes\" label=\"Notes\"></ids-textarea>\n    </form>\n</ids-action-panel>\n```\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Did not exist in 3.X, but any complex modals should be changed to use this.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- 5.x: CAP is now a web component, and is functionally similar to [IdsModal](../ids-modal/README.md), using the same API and events.  The construction of the Modal is declarative and done mostly through HTML markup.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-action-panel></ids-action-panel>`\n- Component is now fully defined in HTML Markup and using slots\n- To hide and show the CAP, use the `visible` property `$('ids-action-panel').visible = false`\n"

A user can place elements inside of the component to represent text. It is recommended to use ids-text components as ids-counts has functionality to manage that input specifically.\n\nA normal Counts component\n\n```html\n<ids-counts href=\"#\">\n  <ids-text count-value>7</ids-text>\n  <ids-text count-text>Active <br /> Opportunities</ids-text>\n</ids-counts>\n```\n\nThe same component could be made \"Not Actionable\" by removing the href attribute\n\n```html\n<ids-counts>\n  <ids-text count-value>7</ids-text>\n  <ids-text count-text>Active <br /> Opportunities</ids-text>\n</ids-counts>\n```\n\nSetting the optional \"Compact\" attribute to \"true\" decreases the font size of the value\n\n```html\n<ids-counts compact=\"true\" href=\"#\">\n  <ids-text count-value>7</ids-text>\n  <ids-text count-text>Active <br /> Opportunities</ids-text>\n</ids-counts>\n```\n\nThe counts component also supports an optional \"Color\" attribute. The options for color are base (blue), caution, error, success, warning, or a hex code with the \"#\"\n\n```html\n<ids-counts href=\"#\" color=\"base\">\n  <ids-text count-value>7</ids-text>\n  <ids-text count-text>Active <br /> Opportunities</ids-text>\n</ids-counts>\n```\n\nCounts using just the css.

Can also a hexadecimal color code beginning with `#`.\n- `compact` {string} Use \"true\" to set the value font-size to 40. Omitting this attribute or using any will result in the default value of 48.\n- `href` {string} The url that the count component links to.\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Actionable\n- Color\n- Compact\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the count is actionable (default) this will toggle through them in the general form order. Non-actionable counts do not get selected.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: This will follow the tag link.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Counts have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The counts component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-counts.\n- Text is now contained in an ids-text element `<ids-text></ids-text>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

When functioning as a read-only element, ratings may use .5 decimals to more accurately display the average rating of an object.\n\nA basic rating with 5 stars by default and none checked.\n\n```html\n<ids-rating></ids-rating>\n```\n\nA rating rating with 4.5/5 which is also readonly. If using half stars the rating component should be readonly as you cannot click half stars in any way with the UI.\n\n```html\n<ids-rating stars=\"5\" readonly=\"true\" value=\"4.5\" size=\"large\"></ids-rating>\n```\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the rating item is enabled this will focus or unfocus the star.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: If this will follow the link url or action.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- `aubible` span are added for screen readers to hear the star information.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `stars` {number} Sets the stars attribute to displayed the amount of items`stars=\"5\"`\n- `value` {number} Sets the rating value attribute. `value=\"0\"`\n- `readyonly` {boolean} Sets the readonly attribute. Valid values are 'true' | 'false'\n- `size` {number} Sets the rating size attribute. `size=\"large\"` Valid values are 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'\n- `mode` {string} Sets the theme mode\n- `version` {string} Sets the theme version\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Rating component was added in v4.0.0\n- Can be invoked on an element with `$('#my-element').rating();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Rating is now a custom element `<ids-rating></ids-rating>`\n\n### Version - 4.x:\n\n```html\n  <div class=\"rating\">\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"is-filled\" name=\"rating-name\" id=\"one-star-id1\"/>\n  <label for=\"one-star-id1\">\n    <svg class=\"icon\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n      <use href=\"#icon-star-filled\"/>\n    </svg>\n    <span class=\"audible\">1 out of 5 Stars</span>\n  </label>\n\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"is-filled\" name=\"rating-name\" id=\"two-star-id1\"/>\n  <label for=\"two-star-id1\">\n    <svg class=\"icon\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n      <use href=\"#icon-star-filled\"/>\n    </svg>\n    <span class=\"audible\">2 out of 5 Stars</span>\n  </label>\n\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"is-filled\" name=\"rating-name\" id=\"three-star-id1\"/>\n  <label for=\"three-star-id1\">\n    <svg class=\"icon\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n      <use href=\"#icon-star-filled\"/>\n    </svg>\n    <span class=\"audible\">3 out of 5 Stars</span>\n  </label>\n\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"is-half\" checked name=\"rating-name\" id=\"four-star-id1\"/>\n  <label for=\"four-star-id1\">\n    <svg class=\"icon\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n      <use href=\"#icon-star-half\"/>\n    </svg>\n    <span class=\"audible\">4 out of 5 Stars</span>\n  </label>\n\n  <input type=\"radio\" name=\"rating-name\" id=\"five-star-id1\"/>\n  <label for=\"five-star-id1\">\n    <svg class=\"icon\" focusable=\"false\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n      <use href=\"#icon-star-filled\"/>\n    </svg>\n    <span class=\"audible\">5 out of 5 Stars</span>\n  </label>\n  </div>\n```\n\n### Version - 5.x:\n\n```html\n  <ids-rating></ids-rating>\n```\n"

        "value": "# Ids Draggable\n\n## Description\n\nA container which limits and tracks the dragging of an HTML Element along a specific axis or within the bounds of it's parent element.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nA draggable would be used in the case where you may have a pane splitter (e.g. in `ids-splitter`, internally), or a list that is meant to be dragged along a specific axis. It may also be used in many cases where we have a canvas or pane that should be resized (in one or two dimensions).\n\nIt does not currently support drag/drop targets in the current iteration, but in the future this component may be used for moving items.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA draggable component with no bounds to where it is moved.\n```html\n <ids-draggable>\n  <div class=\"ids-draggable-demo-box\">\n    <ids-text>Drag Me</ids-text>\n  </div>\n</ids-draggable>\n```\n\nA draggable component along the X axis (e.g. drags horizontally).\n```html\n<ids-draggable axis=\"x\">\n  <div class=\"ids-draggable-demo-box\">\n    <ids-text>Horizontally Draggable</ids-text>\n  </div>\n</ids-draggable>\n```\n\nA draggable component along the Y axis (e.g. drags vertically).\n```html\n<ids-draggable axis=\"y\">\n  <div class=\"ids-draggable-demo-box\">\n    <ids-text>Vertically Draggable</ids-text>\n  </div>\n</ids-draggable>\n```\n\nA draggable component which can be dragged either horizontally or vertically\nbut is contained by it's first non zero-width/height parent (can also work for non-`<div>`, but cannot be a controlled `ids-layout-grid-cell`).\n```html\n<div>\n <ids-draggable parent-containment>\n    <div class=\"ids-draggable-demo-box\">\n      <ids-text>Vertically Draggable</ids-text></div>\n  </ids-draggable>\n</div>\n```\n\nA draggable component which is draggable only by a specific handle on the tab (note: a draggable component currently has a limitation of one handle element, even if the class matches multiple handles).\n```html\n<div>\n <ids-draggable handle=\".drag-handle\">\n    <div class=\"ids-draggable-demo-box\">\n      <ids-icon\n        class=\"drag-handle\"\n        icon=\"drag\"\n        size=\"large\"\n      ></ids-icon>\n      <ids-text>\n        All-content drags, but only .drag-handle is draggable\n      </ids-text>\n    </div>\n  </ids-draggable>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `parent-containment` {boolean} Flags this draggable as having drag range being contained only within the first/closest inner parent of the content with a measurable width or height.\n- `is-draggable` {boolean} Whether or not the `ids-draggable` and content is being dragged.\n- `disabled` {boolean}\n- `axis?` {'x' | 'y'}   The axis that the draggable content will be moving along (e.g. X => horizontal, Y => vertical); By default, not defined and supports both axes.\n- `handle?` {string} A query selector representing an optional handle that can be used to drag the content of the draggable.\n- `min-transform-x` {number} The minimum offset/x-transform/translate the draggable can be translated/dragged on the DOM.\n- `max-transform-x` {number} The maximum offset/x-transform/translate the draggable can be placed from its position on the DOM.\n- `min-transform-y` {number} The minimum offset/y-transform/translate the draggable can be placed from it's position on the DOM.\n- `max-transform-y` {number} The maximum offset/y-transform/translate the draggable can be from it's position on the DOM.\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Wherever possible, it would be worth adding some visual indicator that content is dragged (this can be done using the `is-dragging` attribute or listening on `ids-dragstart` and `ids-dragend` callbacks).\n- if you have text that should be readable, where a minimum width or height is needed, or if it affects presentation, but sure to set reasonable `{min|max}-xform-{x|y}` attributes to restrict the amount of offset on a draggable.\n- It is good to keep in mind that draggable content may present issues for people with visual impairments, and so things such as scrollability and typical keyboard\nnavigation should all function as normal in the case where a user is browsing content that may have resize handles or other draggability aspects.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- The 3.X project had two drag components. This replaces both. The Arrange is new\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Markup and API fully changed\n- Markup has changed to a custom element that wraps draggable content; `<ids-draggable>content</ids-draggable>`.\n- Bounding drag movement to a specific axis is done by passing the axis attribute as `x` or `y`.\n- The Draggable can be contained to the first measurable parent's rectangle bounds by adding the\nflag `parent-container`.\n- A handle within the draggable content can be set by using the attribute `handle` as a query selector e.g. `handle=\".custom-handle-class\"`.\n- Draggable events to listen for are now `ids-dragstart`, `ids-drag`, and `ids-dragend`.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- `ids-draggable` replaces `drag`\n- `ids-swapabble` replaces `arrange`\n- Uses HTML 5 drag drop now\n"

Properties of the `data-options` objects are implemented as attributes of the `ids-step-chart` component as follows:\n\n- `steps: 7` => `step-number=\"7\"`\n- `completed: 2` => `value=\"2\"`\n- `extraText: '2 Days Overdue'` => `completed-label=\"2 Days Overdue\"`\n\nThe `iconType` option has been replaced with a slot called `icon` that can be injected with the desired markup like so:\n\n```html\n<ids-alert slot=\"icon\" icon=\"warning\"></ids-icon>\n```\n\nThe `inProgress` option has been replaced with a property on the component called `stepsInProgress`. This can be set to an array of numbers corresponding to the number of the steps you want to display as in progress. see this example below\n\n```js\neconst element = document.querySelectorAll('ids-step-chart')[3];\nelement.stepsInProgress = ['3'];\n```\n\nColor for `inProgress` steps is not set automatically and a color must be set using the `progress-color` attribute. to duplicate\nexisting red in progress steps use `ruby02`.\n\nlabeling for the step chart is handled through the `label` component attribute and there are no special format requirements\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nKeep in mind that individual steps are not focusable elements as they are purely visual. It is important to keep both primary and secondary labels up to date for screen reader users.\n\n#### Regional Considerations\n\nAdd info on what behaviors or considerations the developer needs to know regarding when running in different languages.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Data Grid\n\n## Description\n\nThe data grid component (ids-data-grid) is used to arrange tabular data in rows and columns for easier scanning and comparison. Data grids are very configurable in both design and functionality and they can be found within almost every product/app.\n\nYou should pass an array of objects in to the grid on the `dataset` object. Also pass the `columns` array which contains the column configuration. There are a number of events described in the events and API section, as well as the column settings.\n\nA Read-Only data grid uses \"Formatters\" to render cell content. A number of these are listed in the API section and it is possible to create your own.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- The data grid component is most useful when it is used for categorically sorting dense and repetitive information. Each individual item is listed down the Y axis of the chart, and their shared attribute categories are listed along the X axis. The resulting cells are filled with information that is relevant to the corresponding item and attribute.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Title**: The name of the data grid optionally appearing above the grid and describing the contents.\n- **Options**: An optionally actions menu button with functionality that operates on the entire data grid.\n- **Cell**: Body elements of the data grid that contain an object's value or attribute. Cells should only contain one type of content or it can be confusing and hurt accessibility.\n- **Header Cell**: These cells contain the names of the columns in the grid and related functions like filtering and sorting. All cells below the header cell will hold values related to the attribute in the header cell.\n- **Column**: Cells stacked vertically that contain values relate to the attribute found on the top header cell.\n- **Row**: Each row contains one cell per column in the data grid, and each cell displays a single value in the bound data item.\n- **Tree**: Denotes the use of hierarchical data, with an expandable and collapsible hierarchy.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `table` allows you to further style the table main element\n- `container` allows you to further style the container element\n- `body` allows you to further style the body element\n- `header` allows you to further style the header element\n- `headerCell` allows you to further style the header cells\n- `row` allows you to further style the rows\n- `cell` allows you to further style the row cells\n- `cell-selected` allows you to further style row cells that are selected (in mixed-selection mode, activated cells are also styled)\n- `tooltip-popup` allows you to further style or adjust the outer tooltip popup element\n- `tooltip-arrow` allows you to adjust the tooltip arrow element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA data grid is created by adding an `ids-data-grid` html element in the page and setting the options either inline in the markup or in the JS part of the code. You can only use simple types (string, boolean ect) for inline markup so passing the data and column arrangement is always done in the JS part. The data will be an array of objects so its in the correct tabular form. The columns are also an array of objects but with defined options and types. See more about columns in next section.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst dataGrid = document.querySelector('#data-grid-1');\ndataGrid.data = dataset;\ndataGrid.columns = columns;\n```\n\n### Column Groups\n\nSetting column groups allows you to add a second level of columns in your header and the ability to group the first level. This is useful for when you have a large number of columns and you want to group them into logical or related sections.\n\nColumn groups are achieved by providing an array to the `columnGroups` setting. Only one level of column groups can be defined.\n\n```js\ndataGrid.columnGroups = [\n{\n  colspan: 3,\n  id: 'group1',\n  name: 'Column Group One',\n  align: 'center'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group2',\n  name: 'Column Group Two'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group3',\n  name: 'Column Group Three',\n  align: 'right'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 11,\n  id: 'group4',\n  name: 'Column Group Four',\n  align: 'left'\n}\n];\n```\n\nIf the column is hidden it will be automatically removed from the `colspan`. If in the last group you didn't provided a bug enough `colspan` it will be set to the remaining columns. The `name` text can be right or left aligned and given an id. The only required property is `colspan`.\n\n### Selection\n\nThe data grid selection feature involves the setting `rowSelection`. This can be one of several values.\n\n- `false` No selection enabled.\n- `multiple` Allows multiple rows to be selected. When doing this it is recommended to add a `formatters.selectionCheckbox` for the first column.\n- `single` Allows a single row to be selected. When doing this you can optionally to add a `formatters.selectionRadio` for the first column. You can use the `suppressRowDeselection` if you want one row to always be selected.\n- `mixed` Allows multiple rows to be selected by clicking only on the checkbox or <kbd>Space</kbd> key. If clicking a row then that row is activated, meaning it is the current row and something might be shown based on the data of that row. You can use the `suppressRowDeactivation` if you want one row to always be selected.\n\nHere is a code example for multi select\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" row-selection=\"multiple\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Selected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowdeselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Deselected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('selectionchanged', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Selection Changed`, e.detail);\n  });\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowselected` Fires when an individual row is activation and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeselected` Fires when an individual row is deselected and gives information about that row.\n`selectionchanged` Fires once for each time selection changes and gives information about all selected rows.\n\n`rowactivated` Fires when an individual row is activated and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeactivated` Fires when an individual row is deactivated and gives information about that row.\n`activationchanged` Fires once for each time activation changes and gives information about the active row.\n\n### Tree Grid\n\nThe tree grid feature involves the setting `treeGrid` to true. In addition the data passed to the tree grid should contain a field called `children`. That contains the child rows. This can by unlimited levels but 2-4 is recommended as a max for a more usable UI. In addition you can preset some states by adding `rowExpanded: false` to the parent elements (default is expanded). And also set `rowHidden: false` for child rows that are expanded. You also need a `Expander` formatter on a cell (usually the first visible cell.\n\nHere is a code example for a tree grid.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"tree-grid\" label=\"Buildings\" tree-grid=\"true\" group-selects-children=\"true\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `groupSelectsChildren` {boolean} If the tree grid has multiple selection, setting this will select all children when a parent is selected.\n- `suppressRowClickSelection` {boolean} If using selection you might want to set this so clicking a row will not select it.\n### Expandable Row\n\nThe Expandable Row feature involves the setting `expandableRow` to true. In addition a row template should be provided via an id that points to the `expandableRowTemplate` which is a `template` element. You can preset the expandable state by adding `rowExpanded: true` to the row element you want to expand. The default is collapsed.\n\nHere is a code example for an expandable row\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid\n    id=\"data-grid-expandable-row\"\n    expandable-row=\"true\"\n    expandable-row-template=\"expandable-row-tmpl\"\n    label=\"Books\">\n    <template id=\"expandable-row-tmpl\">\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"span\">${convention}</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">${price} USD</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">Lorem Ipsum is simply sample text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard sample text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only...</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n    </template>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to expandable rows\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `expandableRowTemplate` {string} Should point to the row `template` element.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe Editing features start by setting `editable` to true. In addition you should add editors to columns and enable features of each of the editors. The features differ depending on the component used for editing. See the Keyboard section for information on which keys can be used when editing..\n\nHere is a code example for an editable text cell.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n    id: 'description',\n    name: 'Description',\n    field: 'description',\n    sortable: true,\n    resizable: true,\n    reorderable: true,\n    formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n    editor: {\n      type: 'input',\n      inline: true,\n      editorSettings: {\n        autoselect: true,\n        dirtyTracker: true\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nHere is a code example for an editable dropdown cell\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'description',\n  name: 'Description',\n  field: 'description',\n  resizable: true,\n  reorderable: true,\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.dropdown,\n  editor: {\n    type: 'dropdown',\n    editorSettings: {\n      dirtyTracker: true,\n      validate: 'required',\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Option 1',\n          value: 'opt1'\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Option 2',\n          value: 'opt2'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo cancel or disabled editing there are a few ways:\n\n- setting the column `editor` setting to undefined will disable editing on the column (as will not having an editor setting at all).\n- adding a `readonly` or `disabled` function which returned true for some cells based on a condition will disable or mark the cell readonly.\n- return false in the `beforecelledit` event in the response function\n\nThe following settings are available on editors.\n\n`type` As of now can be `checkbox`, `input`, `datepicker`, `timepicker`, or `dropdown` but more will be added.\n`inline` Default is false. If true the editor (for example an input) will be visible in a field.\n`editorSettings` Is an object that is loosely typed that lets you pass any option the editor supports in. For example any of the IdsInput or IdsCheckbox options can be passing in. Some special ones are:\n`editorSettings.autoselect` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.dirtyTracker` Enables the dirty tracker that marks changed cells.\n`editorSettings.validate` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.mask` Will pass mask settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.maskOptions` Will pass maskOptions settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.options` Dataset used for dropdown editor's list box options.\n\nWhen the use clicks in the cell or activates editing with the keyboard with the Enter key and types. The following events will fire.\n\n`beforecelledit` Fires before a cell is being edit (before edit is started). Can be vetoed by returning false as shown below.\n`celledit` Fires exactly when a cell is being edited.\n`endcelledit` Fires when a cell edit is completed and changed.\n`cancelcelledit` Fires when an edit is cancelled via the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.\n\nTo cancel editing based on some condition or if editing is not allowed you can veto the `beforecelledit` event.\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('beforecelledit', (e: Event) => {\n    (<CustomEvent>e).detail.response(false);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions for editing the data grid mentioned in the Methods section.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\nWhen used as an attribute in the DOM the settings are kebab case, when used in JS they are camel case.\n\n- `virtualScroll` {boolean} When virtual scroll is used the grid can render many thousands of rows and only the rows visible in the scroll area are rendered for performance.

Each column in the grid should have some unique id.|\n|`name` | {string} | The text to show on the header.|\n|`field` | {string} | The name of the field (column) in the data array attached to the grid for example `description`. This can also be nested in an object for example `children.name`. |\n|`sortable` | {boolean} | If false, the column cannot be sorted. When completed a `sorted` event will fire.|\n|`resizable` | {boolean} | If false the column will not be resizable, thus is a fixed size and can never be changed by the user by dragging the left and right edge.  When completed a `columnresized` event will fire. See the `columns-resizable` example for a working example. |\n|`reorderable` | {boolean} | If true the column can be dragged into another position with adjacent columns. When completed a `columnmoved` event will fire. See the `columns-reorderable` example for a working example. This currently does not work with grouped columns. |\n|`readonly` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to readonly color, indicating no editing.|\n|`disabled` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to disabled color, indicating no editing.|\n|`formatter`| {Function} | Controls how the data is rendered in the cell.|\n|`hidden` | {boolean} | Excludes the column from being added to the DOM.|\n|`align` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align both the cell and the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`headerAlign` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align just the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`minWidth` | {number} | The minimum width used to prevent resizing a column below this size. |\n|`maxWidth` | {number} | The maximum width used to prevent resizing a column above this size. |\n|`cssPart` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of a css part that can be used to customize the cell's css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example. The default cssPart for cells is called `cell` and it also can be used for more global changes.  |\n|`frozen` | {string} | Sets the column to be frozen on either left or right side by passing `left` or `right`. See the `columns-frozen` example for a working example. Frozen columns currently have some limitations to be addressed in the future. |<!--lint disable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`width` | {number or string} | The column width, this can be an integer for fixed pixel width or a percent for example `10%`, if left off the columns will be sized to contents and to fit the width of the grid using the css table browsers handling (this is known as `auto` columns). I.E. There are three column configurations: `auto`, `fixed` and `percent`. <br /><br />In addition one can specify any css grid column setting like `fr` or `ch`. In order to make what was called a `stretchColumn` in previous versions you can set the width to`minmax(130px, 4fr)`. This is some minimum width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (see example columns-stretch.html). For a spacer column you just need to specify one extra column at the end (see example columns-fixed.html) but this is not recommended for how it looks. |<!--lint enable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`headerIcon` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of the header icon. |\n|`tooltipOptions` | {Object or Function} | Allows you to set the tooltip options. See the tooltip example. |\n|`tooltip` | {string or Function} | Let you set the tooltip content. |\n|`headerTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header title tooltip content. |\n|`headerIconTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header icon tooltip content. |\n|`filterButtonTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header filter button tooltip content. |\n|`tooltipCssPart` | {string or Function} | Allows you to set the name of a tooltip css part that can be used to customize the tooltip css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example.\n|`headerTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header tooltip css part.\n|`headerIconTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header icon tooltip css part.\n|`filterButtonTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the filter button tooltip css part.\n|`cellSelectedCssPart` | {string} | Allows customization of a selected cell's background color.\n|`editor` | {object} | Adds an editor to the column if editable is set on the grid. See editing section for more details.\n\n## Column Settings (Specific)\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`href` | {string|Function} | Used to create the href for hyperlink formatters. This can be a string or a function that can work dynamically. It can also replace `{{value}}` with the current value. |\n|`text` | {string} | Used to create the txt value for hyperlink formatters if a hard coded link text is needed. |\n|`disabled` | {boolean|Function} | Sets the cell contents to disabled, can also use a callback to determine this dynamically. Only checkboxes, radios, buttons and link columns can be disabled at this time. Selection columns require disabled rows in order to not be clickable/selectable. |\n\n## Formatters\n\n|Formatter|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | (Default) Formats the column value as a direct text element using toString in the grid cell. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty.|\n|`password` | Formats the column value masking the string length with stars. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty.

The idea behind the formatter is it takes the cell value and does processing on it to return the correct markup for the cell. The simplest custom formatter would be this example.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'custom',\n  name: 'Custom',\n  field: 'price',\n  formatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n    const value = `Custom: ${rowData[columnData.field] || '0'}`;\n    return `<span class=\"text-ellipsis\">${value}</span>`;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo style a custom formatter you may need to add a css part for the element. For example:\n\n```js\nformatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n  const value = `${rowData[columnData.field] || ''}`;\n  return `<a part=\"custom-link\" href=\"#\" class=\"text-ellipsis\">${escapeHTML(value)}</a>`;\n},\n```\n\nThen in the style sheet you add for you page you put the styles.\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link) {\n  color: #da1217;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link):hover {\n  color: #6c080b;\n}\n```\n\nThe formatter is then linked via the column on the formatter setting. When the grid cell is rendered the formatter function is called and the following arguments are passed in.\n\n- `rowData` The current row's data from the data array.\n- `columnData` The column object with all of the column configuration for this cell.\n\n## Events\n\n- `activecellchanged` Fires when the active cell changes with the keyboard or by click.\n- `sorted` Fires when the sort column is changed.\n- `selectionchanged` Fires any time the selection changes.\n- `activationchanged` Fires any time the active row changes.\n- `rowselected` Fires for each row that is selected.\n- `rowdeselected` Fires for each row that is deselected.\n- `rowactivated` Fires for each row that is activated.\n- `rowdeactivated` Fires for each row that is deactivated.\n- `rowclick` Fires for each row that is clicked.\n- `dblclick` Fires each time double clicked on body cells or header cells.

This will automatically render additional rows in the datagrid.\n- `addRow(data: Record<string, unknown>, index?: number)` Adds a new row at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `addRows(data: Array<Record<string, unknown>>, index?: number)` Adds multiple new rows at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `removeRow(index: number)` Removed the provided row index from the dataset and visual datagrid\n- `clearRow(index: number)` Clears all values on the given row.\n- `commitCellEdit` Stops editing and commits the value in the active editor.\n- `cancelCellEdit` Stops editing and reverts the value in the active editor.\n- `resetDirtyCells` Clears all dirty cell indicators.\n- `dirtyCells` Gives a list of all currently dirty cells.\n- `exoprtToExcel(format: 'csv' | 'xlsx', filename: string, keepGridFormatting: boolean)` Export datagrid datasource to an excel file. This keeps grid formatting by default.\n\n## Filters\n\nData rows can be filter based on one or several criteria. Whole filter row can turned on/off by the api setting `filterable` and can be disabled by the api setting `filter-row-disabled`. The filter conditions can be applied thru the UI or programmatically. Each column can have its own filter type and turn on/off by columns setting.\n\n### Filter Columns Setting\n\nAll the filter settings can be passed thru columns data.\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`filterType` | Function | Data grid built-in filter method, see the dedicated section below. |\n|`filterConditions` | Array | List of items to be use as operators in menu-button or options in dropdown. |\n|`filterFunction` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. |\n|`filterOptions` | Object | Setting for components are in use, for example: `label, placeholder, disabled`. |\n|`isChecked` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. This method use along built-in `checkbox` only, when filter data value is not boolean type. |\n\n### Built-in Filter Methods\n\n|Method|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | It filter as text comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`integer` | It filter as integer comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`decimal` | It filter as decimal comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`contents` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and auto generate list of items based on column data. |\n|`dropdown` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and must pass list of item by setting `filterConditions`. |\n|`checkbox` | It filter as boolean comparison. Contains menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`date` | It filter as date comparison. Contains date-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`time` | It filter as time comparison. Contains time-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n\n### Custom Filter\n\nIf the built-in filters are not enough, creating a custom filter is an option. There are two parts you can create both parts custom or mix-match with built-in.\n\n1. `UI Only` In order to do custom UI part of filter, add as html markup thru a slot. It must use slot and column-id attributes for example: `<div slot=\"filter-n\" column-id=\"n\">...</div>` where n is the columnId same passed in the columns.\n1. `filterFunction` This is a user defined filter method which must return a boolean. It determines if a cell value should be considered as a valid filtered value.\n1. `disableClientFilter` This is an api setting to disable filter logic client side. It will set filter conditions and fire an event `filtered` which can listen for custom logic.\n\n### Filter Code Examples\n\nBasic text filters\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"

type=\"text\" size=\"full\" placeholder=\"Slotted description\" label=\"Slotted description input\">\n    </ids-input>\n  </div>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n  filterType: dataGrid.filters.text\n});\n```\n\nDisable client filter\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid

formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n  filterType: dataGrid.filters.text\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('filtered', (e: any) => {\n  console.info('filtered:', e.detail);\n});\n```\n\n### Filter rows programmatically\n\n```js\n// Filter rows\nconst conditions = [{ columnId: 'description', operator: 'contains', value: '5' }];\ndataGrid.applyFilter(conditions);\n\n// Reset all filters\ndataGrid.applyFilter([]);\n```\n\n### Filter Events\n\nThe following events are relevant to data-grid filters.\n\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n\n## Custom cell colors\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to customize the background color of cells.  This can be done with the `cssPart` column setting:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell'\n});\n```\n\nThe `cssPart` property is translated into a `part` attribute that is applied to every cell in the column.  In the event the color needs to be conditional based on the row index or other logic, a function can be used:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nAfter this is defined, accompanying CSS can be written to target the parts `custom-cell`, `custom-cell-1`, and `custom-cell-2` to change background color or other CSS properties of the cell:\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(cell) {\n  background-color: #ebf9f1;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(cell-selected) {\n  background-color: #c9dad0;\n}\n```\n\n### Changing selected cell colors\n\nAnother column setting, `cellSelectedCssPart` can be used alongside `cssPart` to customize the selected color of the row in a similar way.  When using `mixed` selection, this color is also applied to activated rows:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell',\n  cellSelectedCssPart: 'custom-cell-selected'\n});\n```\n\nThis column setting can also be a function, just like `cssPart`:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2'),\n  cellSelectedCssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-selected-1' : 'custom-cell-selected-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Tooltip Code Examples\n\nSet suppress tooltips to turn off.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" suppress-tooltips>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\nSet custom tooltip strings.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: 'This is a product Id',\n  headerTooltip: 'This is the product Id header title',\n  headerIconTooltip: 'This is product Id header icon',\n  filterButtonTooltip: 'This is the product Id filterButton'\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip as callback.\n\n```js\nconst tooltipCallback = (args: any): string => {\n  const { type, columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>Header Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>FilterButton Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  }\n  return `Text: ${text}<br/>for Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: tooltipCallback\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip custom options.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipOptions: {\n

columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return { headerPlacement: 'top', headerX: 0, headerY: 10 };\n  } else if (type === 'header-icon') {\n    return { headerIconPlacement: 'top', headerIconX: 0, headerIconY: 10 };\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return { filterButtonPlacement: 'bottom', filterButtonX: 0, filterButtonY: 22 };\n  }\n  return { placement: 'top', x: 0, y: 10 };\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipOptions: tooltipOptionsCallback\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip custom css.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  headerTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  headerIconTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  filterButtonTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise'\n});\n```\n```css\n/* tooltip css part `custom-turquoise`

parts[randomIndex];\n  }\n  return cssPart;\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipCssPart: tooltipCssPartCallback\n});\n```\n```css\n/* tooltip css part `azure` */\nids-data-grid::part(azure-tooltip-arrow-top)::after {\n  border-top-color:

Filtered\n\n**Cells**\n- Hover (sometimes a cursor change)\n- Readonly\n- Focus\n- Checked/Not Checked (Checkboxes)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd>The initial tab enters the grid with focus on the first cell of the first row, often a header. A second tab moves out of the grid to the next tab stop on the page. Once focus is established in the grid, a TAB into or a Shift Tab into the grid will return to the cell which last had focus. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the next cell.\n- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> Moves the reverse of tab. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the previous cell.\n- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent column's cell. There is no wrap at the end or beginning of columns.\n- <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent row's cell. There is no wrap at the first or last row.\n- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves focus to the first cell of the current row\n- <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the last cell of the current row\n- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> moves focus to the first cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> moves focus to the last cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggles selection the activate row. If suppressRowDeselection is set it will be ignored on deselect. If the cell contains an expandable element then the row will toggle the expanded state. If the cell contains a checkbox editor, will toggle the checkbox state.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> toggles actionable mode. Pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key while in actionable mode moves focus to the next actionable cell. While in actionable mode you can do things like type + enter. This will move you down a row when you hit enter. If the cell has a control that uses down arrow (like the drop downs or lookups that are editable). Then the user needs to hit enter to enable the edit mode on that cell.\n- <kbd>Triple Click</kbd> Not a keyboard shortcut, but if you have text in a cell that is overflowed a triple click will select all the text even the part that is invisible.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> Activates edit mode on the cell if it is editable. There is also an \"auto edit detection\". If the user starts typing then edit mode will happen automatically without enter. If in edit mode already <kbd>Enter</kbd> will finish edit mode. If `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in next row.\n- <kbd>Shift + Enter</kbd> Same as enter but if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in previous row.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter. But if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled, will stay in same cell. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n- <kbd>CMD/CTRL + Enter</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter.\n- <kbd>ESC</kbd> Revert to the previous value and cancel editing. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- By default, data grid grows depending on the amount of contents within and will scroll if necessary under the header. It stops growing when it reaches the size of the parent container.\n- `autoFit` property or `auto-fit` attribute can be set manually to make the data grid size fill and be responsive to the size of the screen, regardless of the amount of contents.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Counts have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Data grid has all new markup and a custom element but some similarly named options\n- Still uses same columns and data set options. Some column options enhanced and changed.\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example: sorted, rendered\n- Some Api Functions have changed\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes or as plain properties for example: data, virtual-scroll\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-data-grid></ids-data-grid>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- `Drill Down` Formatter is now covered by `Button` formatter with `icon=\"drilldown\"`\n- `textOverflow` setting is now by default\n- `rowNavigation` setting has replaced `cellNavigation`. Cell navigation is the default behavior.\n- `stretchColumn` is now more flexible and can be achieved by setting a column width to `minmax(130px, 4fr)`. I.E. some min width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (or similar variations).\n- split columns are not supported anymore but could be done with a custom formatter if needed\n- `frozenColumns` setting is now set on each column by adding `frozen: 'left'` or `frozen: 'right'` to the column definition.\n- Some events are renamed see the events section for more details, also the signature of the events has changed.\n- Custom formatter functions can now be any type of function and have a different signature.\n- The `expanded` column option for tree was renamed to `rowExpanded`.\n- The `expandrow/collapserow` events are renamed to `rowexpanded/rowcollapsed`\n- The `beforeentereditmode/entereditmode/exiteditmode` event is renamed to `beforecelledit/celledit/endcelledit/cancelcelledit`\n- The `actionablemode` feature has been replaced with simply tabbing to the next editable field when in edit mode.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n1.1.1 Non-text Content - All images, links and icons have text labels for screen readers when the formatters are used.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and links and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.\n- 2.1.1 Keyboard - Make all functionality available from a keyboard. The grid has keyboard shortcuts and is usable with a screen reader due to the addition of aria tags.\n- A datagrid in general including this one uses the following aria tags\n  - `aria-label` labels the enter table on the main table\n  - `aria-rowcount` lists the visible row count on the main table\n  - `aria-colindex` the index of each column on the column elements\n  - `aria-rwindex` the index of each row on the row elements\n  - `aria-setsize` for tree grid lists the number of elements in each level (group)\n  - `aria-level` the level of indentation\n  - `aria-posinset` the depth into each set\n  - `aria-expanded` on the row it indicates if the row is expanded (for tree and expandable row)\n  - `aria-sort` indicates the sort direction on the sortable columns\n  - `aria-checked` indicates if the element is checked on checkbox columns and headers\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles and labels should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Code Separation (For Developers)\n\nThe code is divided into several files. Here is a description of where everything is.\n\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.ts` creates a non-shadow root `ids-data-grid-cell`, and handles its own selection, and activation.\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-cell` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-contextmenu.ts` contains code in the form of export functions, that adds ability to get right click menus on headers and cells\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.scss` contains all css related to the filter row and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.ts` contains code to implement the filtering functionality and its ui (some functions are in ids-data-source)\n- `ids-data-grid-formatters.ts` contains all formatter functions and some supporting code like data extraction\n- `ids-data-grid-header.ts` contains most header functionality, the header template, and code related to header actions like sort, reorder and selection.\n- `ids-data-grid-header.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-header` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-row.ts` contains most row functionality, the row template, and code related to row actions like expand, collapse, select, activate\n- `ids-data-grid-row.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-row` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-tooltip-mixin.js` contains a tooltip mixin that adds tooltip functionality to cells and headers, its different from `ids-tooltip-mixin` (more specific)\n- `ids-data-grid.js` contains all main data grid code, the api and settings and the main generator loop for the data grid\n"

        "value": "# Ids Virtual Scroll Component\n\n## Description\n\nVirtual scrolling shows up the visible dom elements to the user, as the user scrolls, the next list is displayed. This gives faster experience as the full list is not loaded at one go and only loaded as per the visibility on the screen.\n\nFor this to work items must be fixed height. We set the item count and item template and then attach a dataset that will be used to render the templates plus a buffer of elements as we scroll up and down in the list.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- For a data grid or list with thousands of elements that do not all need to be loaded at one time\n- For a feed similar to a twitter or facebook feed\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Template**: The html markup to render for each item\n- **Viewport**: The visible scroll area that may not equal all the visible elements\n- **Classification**:  How tags are labelled with colors and text\n- **Disabled**: Tag can be disabled so it cannot be followed or clicked.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nSet up a ids-virtual-scroll container and properties like height, item-height and item-count. Then inside the ids-virtual-scroll element we setup a structure to render where one element is `part=\"contents\"` this is the place where the item template will be rendered with the calculations.\n\n```html\n<ids-virtual-scroll id=\"virtual-scroll-1\" height=\"308\" item-height=\"20\" item-count=\"1000\">\n  <div class=\"ids-list-view\" part=\"contents\"></div>\n</ids-virtual-scroll>\n```\n\n```js\nconst virtualScroll = document.querySelector('#virtual-scroll-1');\nvirtualScrollUl.itemTemplate = (item) => `<li class=\"ids-virtual-scroll-item\" part=\"list-item\">${item.productName}</li>`;\nvirtualScrollUl.data = dataset;\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `itemTemplate` {Function | string} Set the internal element template markup for a single element\n- `data` {Array<Object>} Attach a dataset that matches the list template and render.\n- `scrollTarget` {HTMLElement} Set internal element that will be the scrollable area.\n- `scrollTop` {number} Set the scroll top position and scroll down to that location.\n- `height` {number} The height in pixels we want the scroll area to be.\n- `itemHeight` {number} The height of each item in the list, must be fixed size.\n- `itemCount` {number} The number of elements in the dataset. This is also set internally when attaching data.\n- `bufferSize' {number} The number of extra elements to render to improve or tweak the scroll experience. This needs more research.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Up/Down Arrow</kbd>: If the scroll area is focused using the arrow keys will activate the scrolling.\n- <kbd>Home/End</kbd>: If the scroll area is focused using the arrow keys will scrolling to the start or end of the list\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The width is responsive to the parent\n- The height is responsive to the screensize by default, but can also be specified a fixed `height` i.e. `height=\"500px\"`\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions\n\nNew Component for 5.0\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThe use of this component is not recommended for Accessibility since the lack of elements in the page may pose issues for screen reader and other assistive technology. Consider a way to disable this functionality.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Data Grid\n\n## Description\n\nThe data grid component (ids-data-grid) is used to arrange tabular data in rows and columns for easier scanning and comparison. Data grids are very configurable in both design and functionality and they can be found within almost every product/app.\n\nYou should pass an array of objects in to the grid on the `dataset` object. Also pass the `columns` array which contains the column configuration. There are a number of events described in the events and API section, as well as the column settings.\n\nA Read-Only data grid uses \"Formatters\" to render cell content. A number of these are listed in the API section and it is possible to create your own.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- The data grid component is most useful when it is used for categorically sorting dense and repetitive information. Each individual item is listed down the Y axis of the chart, and their shared attribute categories are listed along the X axis. The resulting cells are filled with information that is relevant to the corresponding item and attribute.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Title**: The name of the data grid optionally appearing above the grid and describing the contents.\n- **Options**: An optionally actions menu button with functionality that operates on the entire data grid.\n- **Cell**: Body elements of the data grid that contain an object's value or attribute. Cells should only contain one type of content or it can be confusing and hurt accessibility.\n- **Header Cell**: These cells contain the names of the columns in the grid and related functions like filtering and sorting. All cells below the header cell will hold values related to the attribute in the header cell.\n- **Column**: Cells stacked vertically that contain values relate to the attribute found on the top header cell.\n- **Row**: Each row contains one cell per column in the data grid, and each cell displays a single value in the bound data item.\n- **Tree**: Denotes the use of hierarchical data, with an expandable and collapsible hierarchy.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `table` allows you to further style the table main element\n- `container` allows you to further style the container element\n- `body` allows you to further style the body element\n- `header` allows you to further style the header element\n- `headerCell` allows you to further style the header cells\n- `row` allows you to further style the rows\n- `cell` allows you to further style the row cells\n- `cell-selected` allows you to further style row cells that are selected (in mixed-selection mode, activated cells are also styled)\n- `tooltip-popup` allows you to further style or adjust the outer tooltip popup element\n- `tooltip-arrow` allows you to adjust the tooltip arrow element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA data grid is created by adding an `ids-data-grid` html element in the page and setting the options either inline in the markup or in the JS part of the code. You can only use simple types (string, boolean ect) for inline markup so passing the data and column arrangement is always done in the JS part. The data will be an array of objects so its in the correct tabular form. The columns are also an array of objects but with defined options and types. See more about columns in next section.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst dataGrid = document.querySelector('#data-grid-1');\ndataGrid.data = dataset;\ndataGrid.columns = columns;\n```\n\n### Column Groups\n\nSetting column groups allows you to add a second level of columns in your header and the ability to group the first level. This is useful for when you have a large number of columns and you want to group them into logical or related sections.\n\nColumn groups are achieved by providing an array to the `columnGroups` setting. Only one level of column groups can be defined.\n\n```js\ndataGrid.columnGroups = [\n{\n  colspan: 3,\n  id: 'group1',\n  name: 'Column Group One',\n  align: 'center'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group2',\n  name: 'Column Group Two'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group3',\n  name: 'Column Group Three',\n  align: 'right'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 11,\n  id: 'group4',\n  name: 'Column Group Four',\n  align: 'left'\n}\n];\n```\n\nIf the column is hidden it will be automatically removed from the `colspan`. If in the last group you didn't provided a bug enough `colspan` it will be set to the remaining columns. The `name` text can be right or left aligned and given an id. The only required property is `colspan`.\n\n### Selection\n\nThe data grid selection feature involves the setting `rowSelection`. This can be one of several values.\n\n- `false` No selection enabled.\n- `multiple` Allows multiple rows to be selected. When doing this it is recommended to add a `formatters.selectionCheckbox` for the first column.\n- `single` Allows a single row to be selected. When doing this you can optionally to add a `formatters.selectionRadio` for the first column. You can use the `suppressRowDeselection` if you want one row to always be selected.\n- `mixed` Allows multiple rows to be selected by clicking only on the checkbox or <kbd>Space</kbd> key. If clicking a row then that row is activated, meaning it is the current row and something might be shown based on the data of that row. You can use the `suppressRowDeactivation` if you want one row to always be selected.\n\nHere is a code example for multi select\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" row-selection=\"multiple\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Selected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowdeselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Deselected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('selectionchanged', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Selection Changed`, e.detail);\n  });\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowselected` Fires when an individual row is activation and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeselected` Fires when an individual row is deselected and gives information about that row.\n`selectionchanged` Fires once for each time selection changes and gives information about all selected rows.\n\n`rowactivated` Fires when an individual row is activated and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeactivated` Fires when an individual row is deactivated and gives information about that row.\n`activationchanged` Fires once for each time activation changes and gives information about the active row.\n\n### Tree Grid\n\nThe tree grid feature involves the setting `treeGrid` to true. In addition the data passed to the tree grid should contain a field called `children`. That contains the child rows. This can by unlimited levels but 2-4 is recommended as a max for a more usable UI. In addition you can preset some states by adding `rowExpanded: false` to the parent elements (default is expanded). And also set `rowHidden: false` for child rows that are expanded. You also need a `Expander` formatter on a cell (usually the first visible cell.\n\nHere is a code example for a tree grid.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"tree-grid\" label=\"Buildings\" tree-grid=\"true\" group-selects-children=\"true\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `groupSelectsChildren` {boolean} If the tree grid has multiple selection, setting this will select all children when a parent is selected.\n- `suppressRowClickSelection` {boolean} If using selection you might want to set this so clicking a row will not select it.\n### Expandable Row\n\nThe Expandable Row feature involves the setting `expandableRow` to true. In addition a row template should be provided via an id that points to the `expandableRowTemplate` which is a `template` element. You can preset the expandable state by adding `rowExpanded: true` to the row element you want to expand. The default is collapsed.\n\nHere is a code example for an expandable row\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid\n    id=\"data-grid-expandable-row\"\n    expandable-row=\"true\"\n    expandable-row-template=\"expandable-row-tmpl\"\n    label=\"Books\">\n    <template id=\"expandable-row-tmpl\">\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"span\">${convention}</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">${price} USD</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">Lorem Ipsum is simply sample text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard sample text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only...</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n    </template>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to expandable rows\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `expandableRowTemplate` {string} Should point to the row `template` element.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe Editing features start by setting `editable` to true. In addition you should add editors to columns and enable features of each of the editors. The features differ depending on the component used for editing. See the Keyboard section for information on which keys can be used when editing..\n\nHere is a code example for an editable text cell.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n    id: 'description',\n    name: 'Description',\n    field: 'description',\n    sortable: true,\n    resizable: true,\n    reorderable: true,\n    formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n    editor: {\n      type: 'input',\n      inline: true,\n      editorSettings: {\n        autoselect: true,\n        dirtyTracker: true\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nHere is a code example for an editable dropdown cell\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'description',\n  name: 'Description',\n  field: 'description',\n  resizable: true,\n  reorderable: true,\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.dropdown,\n  editor: {\n    type: 'dropdown',\n    editorSettings: {\n      dirtyTracker: true,\n      validate: 'required',\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Option 1',\n          value: 'opt1'\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Option 2',\n          value: 'opt2'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo cancel or disabled editing there are a few ways:\n\n- setting the column `editor` setting to undefined will disable editing on the column (as will not having an editor setting at all).\n- adding a `readonly` or `disabled` function which returned true for some cells based on a condition will disable or mark the cell readonly.\n- return false in the `beforecelledit` event in the response function\n\nThe following settings are available on editors.\n\n`type` As of now can be `checkbox`, `input`, `datepicker`, `timepicker`, or `dropdown` but more will be added.\n`inline` Default is false. If true the editor (for example an input) will be visible in a field.\n`editorSettings` Is an object that is loosely typed that lets you pass any option the editor supports in. For example any of the IdsInput or IdsCheckbox options can be passing in. Some special ones are:\n`editorSettings.autoselect` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.dirtyTracker` Enables the dirty tracker that marks changed cells.\n`editorSettings.validate` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.mask` Will pass mask settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.maskOptions` Will pass maskOptions settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.options` Dataset used for dropdown editor's list box options.\n\nWhen the use clicks in the cell or activates editing with the keyboard with the Enter key and types. The following events will fire.\n\n`beforecelledit` Fires before a cell is being edit (before edit is started). Can be vetoed by returning false as shown below.\n`celledit` Fires exactly when a cell is being edited.\n`endcelledit` Fires when a cell edit is completed and changed.\n`cancelcelledit` Fires when an edit is cancelled via the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.\n\nTo cancel editing based on some condition or if editing is not allowed you can veto the `beforecelledit` event.\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('beforecelledit', (e: Event) => {\n    (<CustomEvent>e).detail.response(false);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions for editing the data grid mentioned in the Methods section.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\nWhen used as an attribute in the DOM the settings are kebab case, when used in JS they are camel case.\n\n- `virtualScroll` {boolean} When virtual scroll is used the grid can render many thousands of rows and only the rows visible in the scroll area are rendered for performance. This setting has limitations such as the rows need to be fixed size.\n- `addNewAtEnd` {boolean} Automatically append rows while keyboard navigating data grid in edit mode.\n- `alternateRowShading` {boolean} For better scan-ability you can shade alternate rows.\n- `listStyle` {boolean} Sets the style of the grid to list style for simple readonly lists.\n- `columns` {Array<object>} Sets the columns array of the data grid. See column settings.\n- `columnGroups` {Array<object>} Allows you to group columns together in logical sets. See section below for details.\n- `rowHeight` {string | `'xs'` | `'sm'` | `'md'` | `'lg'`} Sets the height of each row\n- `data` {Array<object>} Sets the data to show in the data grid. This can be a JSON Array.\n- `disableClientFilter` {boolean} Disables the filter logic client side in situations you want to filter server side.\n- `filterable` {boolean} Turns on or off the filter functionality.\n- `filterRowDisabled` {boolean} Disables the filter row.\n- `headerMenuData` {Array<object>} Dataset to build context menu for header and header group cells.\n- `headerMenuId` {string} ID of the popupmenu to use as context menu for header and header group cells.\n- `menuData` {Array<object>} Dataset to build context menu for body cells.\n- `menuId` {string} ID of the popupmenu to use as context menu for body cells.\n- `rowNavigation` {boolean} If using row navigation, the row will be focused when navigating the data grid via clicks and keyboard events.\n- `rowSelection` {string|boolean} Set the row selection mode between false, 'single', 'multiple' and 'mixed\n- `suppressRowClickSelection` {boolean} If using selection setting this will require clicking a checkbox or radio to select the row. Clicking other cells will not select the row.\n- `suppressRowDeactivation` {boolean} Set to true to prevent rows from being deactivated if clicked. i.e. once a row is activated, it remains activated until another row is activated in its place.\n- `suppressRowDeselection`  {boolean} Set to true to prevent rows from being deselected if click or space bar the row. i.e. once a row is selected, it remains selected until another row is selected in its place.\n- `suppressTooltips`  {boolean} Set to true to prevent display tooltips.\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `expandableRow` {boolean} Indicates expandable rows will be used in the data grid.  See the expandable row section for more details.\n- `expandableRowTemplate` {string} Should point to the row `template` element for expandable rows.\n- `treeGrid` {boolean} Indicates a tree grid will be used  in the data grid. See the tree grid section for more details.\n- `groupSelectsChildren` {boolean} If a tree grid has multiple selection, setting this will select all children when a parent is selected.\n- `saveActivePage` {boolean} If set the active page on the pager will be saved to local storage.\n- `saveColumns` {boolean} If set columns will be saved to local storage.\n- `saveFilter` {boolean} If set filter will be saved to local storage.\n- `savePageSize` {boolean} If set the page size on the pager will be saved to local storage.\n- `saveRowHeight` {boolean} If set row height will be saved to local storage.\n- `saveSortOrder` {boolean} If set column sort order will be saved to local storage.\n- `saveUserSettings` {boolean} If set all settings will be saved to local storage.\n- `emptyMessageDescription` {string} Set empty message description text.\n- `emptyMessageIcon` {string} Set empty message icon name.\n- `emptyMessageLabel` {string} Set empty message label text.\n- `suppressEmptyMessage` {boolean} Set to true to prevent display empty message.\n- `editable` {boolean} If true in addition to adding editors to columns the data grid is editable.\n- `editNextOnEnterPress` {boolean} If enabled when editing using <kbd>ENTER</kbd> will finish editing and start editing the same cell in next row and <kbd>SHIFT + ENTER</kbd> will edit the previous row.\n\n## Column Settings (General)\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`id` | {string} | The unique id of the column. Each column in the grid should have some unique id.|\n|`name` | {string} | The text to show on the header.|\n|`field` | {string} | The name of the field (column) in the data array attached to the grid for example `description`. This can also be nested in an object for example `children.name`. |\n|`sortable` | {boolean} | If false, the column cannot be sorted. When completed a `sorted` event will fire.|\n|`resizable` | {boolean} | If false the column will not be resizable, thus is a fixed size and can never be changed by the user by dragging the left and right edge.  When completed a `columnresized` event will fire. See the `columns-resizable` example for a working example. |\n|`reorderable` | {boolean} | If true the column can be dragged into another position with adjacent columns. When completed a `columnmoved` event will fire. See the `columns-reorderable` example for a working example. This currently does not work with grouped columns. |\n|`readonly` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to readonly color, indicating no editing.|\n|`disabled` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to disabled color, indicating no editing.|\n|`formatter`| {Function} | Controls how the data is rendered in the cell.|\n|`hidden` | {boolean} | Excludes the column from being added to the DOM.|\n|`align` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align both the cell and the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`headerAlign` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align just the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`minWidth` | {number} | The minimum width used to prevent resizing a column below this size. |\n|`maxWidth` | {number} | The maximum width used to prevent resizing a column above this size. |\n|`cssPart` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of a css part that can be used to customize the cell's css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example. The default cssPart for cells is called `cell` and it also can be used for more global changes.  |\n|`frozen` | {string} | Sets the column to be frozen on either left or right side by passing `left` or `right`. See the `columns-frozen` example for a working example. Frozen columns currently have some limitations to be addressed in the future. |<!--lint disable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`width` | {number or string} | The column width, this can be an integer for fixed pixel width or a percent for example `10%`, if left off the columns will be sized to contents and to fit the width of the grid using the css table browsers handling (this is known as `auto` columns). I.E. There are three column configurations: `auto`, `fixed` and `percent`. <br /><br />In addition one can specify any css grid column setting like `fr` or `ch`. In order to make what was called a `stretchColumn` in previous versions you can set the width to`minmax(130px, 4fr)`. This is some minimum width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (see example columns-stretch.html). For a spacer column you just need to specify one extra column at the end (see example columns-fixed.html) but this is not recommended for how it looks. |<!--lint enable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`headerIcon` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of the header icon. |\n|`tooltipOptions` | {Object or Function} | Allows you to set the tooltip options. See the tooltip example. |\n|`tooltip` | {string or Function} | Let you set the tooltip content. |\n|`headerTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header title tooltip content. |\n|`headerIconTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header icon tooltip content. |\n|`filterButtonTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header filter button tooltip content. |\n|`tooltipCssPart` | {string or Function} | Allows you to set the name of a tooltip css part that can be used to customize the tooltip css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example.\n|`headerTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header tooltip css part.\n|`headerIconTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header icon tooltip css part.\n|`filterButtonTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the filter button tooltip css part.\n|`cellSelectedCssPart` | {string} | Allows customization of a selected cell's background color.\n|`editor` | {object} | Adds an editor to the column if editable is set on the grid. See editing section for more details.\n\n## Column Settings (Specific)\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`href` | {string|Function} | Used to create the href for hyperlink formatters. This can be a string or a function that can work dynamically. It can also replace `{{value}}` with the current value. |\n|`text` | {string} | Used to create the txt value for hyperlink formatters if a hard coded link text is needed. |\n|`disabled` | {boolean|Function} | Sets the cell contents to disabled, can also use a callback to determine this dynamically. Only checkboxes, radios, buttons and link columns can be disabled at this time. Selection columns require disabled rows in order to not be clickable/selectable. |\n\n## Formatters\n\n|Formatter|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | (Default) Formats the column value as a direct text element using toString in the grid cell. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty.|\n|`password` | Formats the column value masking the string length with stars. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty. This is good for private data. |\n|`rowNumber` | Formats the cell with a row number column that is shown 1 to n no matter what the sort order is. |\n|`date` | Formats date data as a date string in the desired format, by default it will use `dateStyle: 'short'` for other options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions` |\n|`time` | Formats date data as a time string in the desired format, by default it will use `timeStyle: 'short'` for other options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions` |\n|`decimal` | Formats number data as a decimal string in the specified locale. For additional options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions`. |\n|`integer` | Formats number data as a integer string in the specified locale. For additional options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions`. |\n|`selectionCheckbox` | Displays a checkbox column for selection when using `rowSelection=\"mixed\"` or `rowSelection=\"multiple\"`|\n|`selectionRadio` | Displays a checkbox column for selection when using `rowSelection=\"single\"` |\n| `button` | Displays an `ids-button`. Other column settings like `type` can be used to set the button type as can `icon` by set for icon only buttons. Use the `click` setting/function to get an callback handler. |\n| `hyperlink` | Displays an `ids-hyperlink`. Other column settings like `href` can be used to set the link href and `text` can be used to set the text to specific text. Use the `click` setting/function to get an callback handler. |\n| `checkbox` | Displays an `ids-checkbox`. The value will be checked depending on if the attached field is true or `\"true\"`. |\n| `badge` | Displays an `ids-badge`. The associated field will be placed in the badge.

The idea behind the formatter is it takes the cell value and does processing on it to return the correct markup for the cell. The simplest custom formatter would be this example.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'custom',\n  name: 'Custom',\n  field: 'price',\n  formatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n    const value = `Custom: ${rowData[columnData.field] || '0'}`;\n    return `<span class=\"text-ellipsis\">${value}</span>`;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo style a custom formatter you may need to add a css part for the element. For example:\n\n```js\nformatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n  const value = `${rowData[columnData.field] || ''}`;\n  return `<a part=\"custom-link\" href=\"#\" class=\"text-ellipsis\">${escapeHTML(value)}</a>`;\n},\n```\n\nThen in the style sheet you add for you page you put the styles.\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link) {\n  color: #da1217;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link):hover {\n  color: #6c080b;\n}\n```\n\nThe formatter is then linked via the column on the formatter setting. When the grid cell is rendered the formatter function is called and the following arguments are passed in.\n\n- `rowData` The current row's data from the data array.\n- `columnData` The column object with all of the column configuration for this cell.\n\n## Events\n\n- `activecellchanged` Fires when the active cell changes with the keyboard or by click.\n- `sorted` Fires when the sort column is changed.\n- `selectionchanged` Fires any time the selection changes.\n- `activationchanged` Fires any time the active row changes.\n- `rowselected` Fires for each row that is selected.\n- `rowdeselected` Fires for each row that is deselected.\n- `rowactivated` Fires for each row that is activated.\n- `rowdeactivated` Fires for each row that is deactivated.\n- `rowclick` Fires for each row that is clicked.\n- `dblclick` Fires each time double clicked on body cells or header cells. Based on where it clicked details can be capture like `type: 'body-cell'|'header-title'|'header-filter'` etc.\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n- `columnresized` Fires when a column is resized or setColumnWidth is called.\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `rowExpanded` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `rowCollapsed` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called.\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `beforemenushow` Fires before context menu show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `menushow` Fires after context menu show.\n- `menuselected` Fires after context menu item selected.\n- `settingschanged` Fires after settings are changed in some way.\n- `scrollstart` Fires when data-grid reaches the topmost row.\n- `scrollend` Fires when data-grid reaches the bottommost row.\n\n## Methods\n\n- `setColumnWidth` Can be used to set the width of a column.\n- `setColumnVisibility` Can be used to set the visibility of a column.\n- `setActivateCell(cell, row)` Can be used to set focus of a cell.\n- `selectedRows` Lists the indexes of the currently selected rows.\n- `saveSetting(setting: string)` Save the given setting to local storage.\n- `saveAllSettings` Save all user settings to local storage.\n- `savedSetting(setting: string)` Get saved given setting value from local storage.\n- `allSavedSettings` Get saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `clearSetting(setting: string, key?: string)` Clear the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `clearAllSettings(userKeys: unknown)` Clear saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `restoreSetting(setting: string, value?: unknown)` Restore the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `editFirstCell` Puts the first cell on the active row into edit mode.\n- `appendData(data: Record<string, unknown>)` Use this to add more data to the datagrid's existing dataset.  This will automatically render additional rows in the datagrid.\n- `addRow(data: Record<string, unknown>, index?: number)` Adds a new row at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `addRows(data: Array<Record<string, unknown>>, index?: number)` Adds multiple new rows at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `removeRow(index: number)` Removed the provided row index from the dataset and visual datagrid\n- `clearRow(index: number)` Clears all values on the given row.\n- `commitCellEdit` Stops editing and commits the value in the active editor.\n- `cancelCellEdit` Stops editing and reverts the value in the active editor.\n- `resetDirtyCells` Clears all dirty cell indicators.\n- `dirtyCells` Gives a list of all currently dirty cells.\n- `exoprtToExcel(format: 'csv' | 'xlsx', filename: string, keepGridFormatting: boolean)` Export datagrid datasource to an excel file. This keeps grid formatting by default.\n\n## Filters\n\nData rows can be filter based on one or several criteria. Whole filter row can turned on/off by the api setting `filterable` and can be disabled by the api setting `filter-row-disabled`. The filter conditions can be applied thru the UI or programmatically. Each column can have its own filter type and turn on/off by columns setting.\n\n### Filter Columns Setting\n\nAll the filter settings can be passed thru columns data.\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`filterType` | Function | Data grid built-in filter method, see the dedicated section below. |\n|`filterConditions` | Array | List of items to be use as operators in menu-button or options in dropdown. |\n|`filterFunction` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. |\n|`filterOptions` | Object | Setting for components are in use, for example: `label, placeholder, disabled`. |\n|`isChecked` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. This method use along built-in `checkbox` only, when filter data value is not boolean type. |\n\n### Built-in Filter Methods\n\n|Method|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | It filter as text comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`integer` | It filter as integer comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`decimal` | It filter as decimal comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`contents` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and auto generate list of items based on column data. |\n|`dropdown` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and must pass list of item by setting `filterConditions`. |\n|`checkbox` | It filter as boolean comparison. Contains menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`date` | It filter as date comparison. Contains date-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`time` | It filter as time comparison. Contains time-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n\n### Custom Filter\n\nIf the built-in filters are not enough, creating a custom filter is an option. There are two parts you can create both parts custom or mix-match with built-in.\n\n1. `UI Only` In order to do custom UI part of filter, add as html markup thru a slot. It must use slot and column-id attributes for example: `<div slot=\"filter-n\" column-id=\"n\">...</div>` where n is the columnId same passed in the columns.\n1. `filterFunction` This is a user defined filter method which must return a boolean. It determines if a cell value should be considered as a valid filtered value.\n1. `disableClientFilter` This is an api setting to disable filter logic client side. It will set filter conditions and fire an event `filtered` which can listen for custom logic.\n\n### Filter Code Examples\n\nBasic text filters\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"

id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n  filterType: dataGrid.filters.text\n});\n```\n\nDisable client filter\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" disable-client-filter=\"true\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n  filterType: dataGrid.filters.text\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('filtered', (e: any) => {\n  console.info('filtered:', e.detail);\n});\n```\n\n### Filter rows programmatically\n\n```js\n// Filter rows\nconst conditions = [{ columnId: 'description', operator: 'contains', value: '5' }];\ndataGrid.applyFilter(conditions);\n\n// Reset all filters\ndataGrid.applyFilter([]);\n```\n\n### Filter Events\n\nThe following events are relevant to data-grid filters.\n\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n\n## Custom cell colors\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to customize the background color of cells.  This can be done with the `cssPart` column setting:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell'\n});\n```\n\nThe `cssPart` property is translated into a `part` attribute that is applied to every cell in the column.  In the event the color needs to be conditional based on the row index or other logic, a function can be used:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nAfter this is defined, accompanying CSS can be written to target the parts `custom-cell`, `custom-cell-1`, and `custom-cell-2` to change background color or other CSS properties of the cell:\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(cell) {\n  background-color: #ebf9f1;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(cell-selected) {\n  background-color: #c9dad0;\n}\n```\n\n### Changing selected cell colors\n\nAnother column setting, `cellSelectedCssPart` can be used alongside `cssPart` to customize the selected color of the row in a similar way.  When using `mixed` selection, this color is also applied to activated rows:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell',\n  cellSelectedCssPart: 'custom-cell-selected'\n});\n```\n\nThis column setting can also be a function, just like `cssPart`:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2'),\n  cellSelectedCssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-selected-1' : 'custom-cell-selected-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Tooltip Code Examples\n\nSet suppress tooltips to turn off.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" suppress-tooltips>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\nSet custom tooltip strings.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: 'This is a product Id',\n  headerTooltip: 'This is the product Id header title',\n  headerIconTooltip: 'This is product Id header icon',\n  filterButtonTooltip: 'This is the product Id filterButton'\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip as callback.\n\n```js\nconst tooltipCallback = (args: any): string => {\n  const { type, columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>Header Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>FilterButton Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell:

Filtered\n\n**Cells**\n- Hover (sometimes a cursor change)\n- Readonly\n- Focus\n- Checked/Not Checked (Checkboxes)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd>The initial tab enters the grid with focus on the first cell of the first row, often a header. A second tab moves out of the grid to the next tab stop on the page. Once focus is established in the grid, a TAB into or a Shift Tab into the grid will return to the cell which last had focus. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the next cell.\n- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> Moves the reverse of tab. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the previous cell.\n- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent column's cell. There is no wrap at the end or beginning of columns.\n- <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent row's cell. There is no wrap at the first or last row.\n- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves focus to the first cell of the current row\n- <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the last cell of the current row\n- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> moves focus to the first cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> moves focus to the last cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggles selection the activate row. If suppressRowDeselection is set it will be ignored on deselect. If the cell contains an expandable element then the row will toggle the expanded state. If the cell contains a checkbox editor, will toggle the checkbox state.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> toggles actionable mode. Pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key while in actionable mode moves focus to the next actionable cell. While in actionable mode you can do things like type + enter. This will move you down a row when you hit enter. If the cell has a control that uses down arrow (like the drop downs or lookups that are editable). Then the user needs to hit enter to enable the edit mode on that cell.\n- <kbd>Triple Click</kbd> Not a keyboard shortcut, but if you have text in a cell that is overflowed a triple click will select all the text even the part that is invisible.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> Activates edit mode on the cell if it is editable. There is also an \"auto edit detection\". If the user starts typing then edit mode will happen automatically without enter. If in edit mode already <kbd>Enter</kbd> will finish edit mode. If `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in next row.\n- <kbd>Shift + Enter</kbd> Same as enter but if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in previous row.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter. But if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled, will stay in same cell. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n- <kbd>CMD/CTRL + Enter</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter.\n- <kbd>ESC</kbd> Revert to the previous value and cancel editing. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- By default, data grid grows depending on the amount of contents within and will scroll if necessary under the header. It stops growing when it reaches the size of the parent container.\n- `autoFit` property or `auto-fit` attribute can be set manually to make the data grid size fill and be responsive to the size of the screen, regardless of the amount of contents.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Counts have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Data grid has all new markup and a custom element but some similarly named options\n- Still uses same columns and data set options. Some column options enhanced and changed.\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example: sorted, rendered\n- Some Api Functions have changed\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes or as plain properties for example: data, virtual-scroll\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-data-grid></ids-data-grid>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- `Drill Down` Formatter is now covered by `Button` formatter with `icon=\"drilldown\"`\n- `textOverflow` setting is now by default\n- `rowNavigation` setting has replaced `cellNavigation`. Cell navigation is the default behavior.\n- `stretchColumn` is now more flexible and can be achieved by setting a column width to `minmax(130px, 4fr)`. I.E. some min width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (or similar variations).\n- split columns are not supported anymore but could be done with a custom formatter if needed\n- `frozenColumns` setting is now set on each column by adding `frozen: 'left'` or `frozen: 'right'` to the column definition.\n- Some events are renamed see the events section for more details, also the signature of the events has changed.\n- Custom formatter functions can now be any type of function and have a different signature.\n- The `expanded` column option for tree was renamed to `rowExpanded`.\n- The `expandrow/collapserow` events are renamed to `rowexpanded/rowcollapsed`\n- The `beforeentereditmode/entereditmode/exiteditmode` event is renamed to `beforecelledit/celledit/endcelledit/cancelcelledit`\n- The `actionablemode` feature has been replaced with simply tabbing to the next editable field when in edit mode.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n1.1.1 Non-text Content - All images, links and icons have text labels for screen readers when the formatters are used.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and links and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.\n- 2.1.1 Keyboard - Make all functionality available from a keyboard. The grid has keyboard shortcuts and is usable with a screen reader due to the addition of aria tags.\n- A datagrid in general including this one uses the following aria tags\n  - `aria-label` labels the enter table on the main table\n  - `aria-rowcount` lists the visible row count on the main table\n  - `aria-colindex` the index of each column on the column elements\n  - `aria-rwindex` the index of each row on the row elements\n  - `aria-setsize` for tree grid lists the number of elements in each level (group)\n  - `aria-level` the level of indentation\n  - `aria-posinset` the depth into each set\n  - `aria-expanded` on the row it indicates if the row is expanded (for tree and expandable row)\n  - `aria-sort` indicates the sort direction on the sortable columns\n  - `aria-checked` indicates if the element is checked on checkbox columns and headers\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles and labels should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Code Separation (For Developers)\n\nThe code is divided into several files. Here is a description of where everything is.\n\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.ts` creates a non-shadow root `ids-data-grid-cell`, and handles its own selection, and activation.\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-cell` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-contextmenu.ts` contains code in the form of export functions, that adds ability to get right click menus on headers and cells\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.scss` contains all css related to the filter row and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.ts` contains code to implement the filtering functionality and its ui (some functions are in ids-data-source)\n- `ids-data-grid-formatters.ts` contains all formatter functions and some supporting code like data extraction\n- `ids-data-grid-header.ts` contains most header functionality, the header template, and code related to header actions like sort, reorder and selection.\n- `ids-data-grid-header.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-header` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-row.ts` contains most row functionality, the row template, and code related to row actions like expand, collapse, select, activate\n- `ids-data-grid-row.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-row` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-tooltip-mixin.js` contains a tooltip mixin that adds tooltip functionality to cells and headers, its different from `ids-tooltip-mixin` (more specific)\n- `ids-data-grid.js` contains all main data grid code, the api and settings and the main generator loop for the data grid\n"

        "value": "# Ids Data Grid\n\n## Description\n\nThe data grid component (ids-data-grid) is used to arrange tabular data in rows and columns for easier scanning and comparison. Data grids are very configurable in both design and functionality and they can be found within almost every product/app.\n\nYou should pass an array of objects in to the grid on the `dataset` object. Also pass the `columns` array which contains the column configuration. There are a number of events described in the events and API section, as well as the column settings.\n\nA Read-Only data grid uses \"Formatters\" to render cell content. A number of these are listed in the API section and it is possible to create your own.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- The data grid component is most useful when it is used for categorically sorting dense and repetitive information. Each individual item is listed down the Y axis of the chart, and their shared attribute categories are listed along the X axis. The resulting cells are filled with information that is relevant to the corresponding item and attribute.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Title**: The name of the data grid optionally appearing above the grid and describing the contents.\n- **Options**: An optionally actions menu button with functionality that operates on the entire data grid.\n- **Cell**: Body elements of the data grid that contain an object's value or attribute. Cells should only contain one type of content or it can be confusing and hurt accessibility.\n- **Header Cell**: These cells contain the names of the columns in the grid and related functions like filtering and sorting. All cells below the header cell will hold values related to the attribute in the header cell.\n- **Column**: Cells stacked vertically that contain values relate to the attribute found on the top header cell.\n- **Row**: Each row contains one cell per column in the data grid, and each cell displays a single value in the bound data item.\n- **Tree**: Denotes the use of hierarchical data, with an expandable and collapsible hierarchy.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `table` allows you to further style the table main element\n- `container` allows you to further style the container element\n- `body` allows you to further style the body element\n- `header` allows you to further style the header element\n- `headerCell` allows you to further style the header cells\n- `row` allows you to further style the rows\n- `cell` allows you to further style the row cells\n- `cell-selected` allows you to further style row cells that are selected (in mixed-selection mode, activated cells are also styled)\n- `tooltip-popup` allows you to further style or adjust the outer tooltip popup element\n- `tooltip-arrow` allows you to adjust the tooltip arrow element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA data grid is created by adding an `ids-data-grid` html element in the page and setting the options either inline in the markup or in the JS part of the code. You can only use simple types (string, boolean ect) for inline markup so passing the data and column arrangement is always done in the JS part. The data will be an array of objects so its in the correct tabular form. The columns are also an array of objects but with defined options and types. See more about columns in next section.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst dataGrid = document.querySelector('#data-grid-1');\ndataGrid.data = dataset;\ndataGrid.columns = columns;\n```\n\n### Column Groups\n\nSetting column groups allows you to add a second level of columns in your header and the ability to group the first level. This is useful for when you have a large number of columns and you want to group them into logical or related sections.\n\nColumn groups are achieved by providing an array to the `columnGroups` setting. Only one level of column groups can be defined.\n\n```js\ndataGrid.columnGroups = [\n{\n  colspan: 3,\n  id: 'group1',\n  name: 'Column Group One',\n  align: 'center'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group2',\n  name: 'Column Group Two'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group3',\n  name: 'Column Group Three',\n  align: 'right'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 11,\n  id: 'group4',\n  name: 'Column Group Four',\n  align: 'left'\n}\n];\n```\n\nIf the column is hidden it will be automatically removed from the `colspan`. If in the last group you didn't provided a bug enough `colspan` it will be set to the remaining columns. The `name` text can be right or left aligned and given an id. The only required property is `colspan`.\n\n### Selection\n\nThe data grid selection feature involves the setting `rowSelection`. This can be one of several values.\n\n- `false` No selection enabled.\n- `multiple` Allows multiple rows to be selected. When doing this it is recommended to add a `formatters.selectionCheckbox` for the first column.\n- `single` Allows a single row to be selected. When doing this you can optionally to add a `formatters.selectionRadio` for the first column. You can use the `suppressRowDeselection` if you want one row to always be selected.\n- `mixed` Allows multiple rows to be selected by clicking only on the checkbox or <kbd>Space</kbd> key. If clicking a row then that row is activated, meaning it is the current row and something might be shown based on the data of that row. You can use the `suppressRowDeactivation` if you want one row to always be selected.\n\nHere is a code example for multi select\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" row-selection=\"multiple\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Selected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowdeselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Deselected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('selectionchanged', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Selection Changed`, e.detail);\n  });\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowselected` Fires when an individual row is activation and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeselected` Fires when an individual row is deselected and gives information about that row.\n`selectionchanged` Fires once for each time selection changes and gives information about all selected rows.\n\n`rowactivated` Fires when an individual row is activated and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeactivated` Fires when an individual row is deactivated and gives information about that row.\n`activationchanged` Fires once for each time activation changes and gives information about the active row.\n\n### Tree Grid\n\nThe tree grid feature involves the setting `treeGrid` to true. In addition the data passed to the tree grid should contain a field called `children`. That contains the child rows. This can by unlimited levels but 2-4 is recommended as a max for a more usable UI. In addition you can preset some states by adding `rowExpanded: false` to the parent elements (default is expanded). And also set `rowHidden: false` for child rows that are expanded. You also need a `Expander` formatter on a cell (usually the first visible cell.\n\nHere is a code example for a tree grid.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"tree-grid\" label=\"Buildings\" tree-grid=\"true\" group-selects-children=\"true\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `groupSelectsChildren` {boolean} If the tree grid has multiple selection, setting this will select all children when a parent is selected.\n- `suppressRowClickSelection` {boolean} If using selection you might want to set this so clicking a row will not select it.\n### Expandable Row\n\nThe Expandable Row feature involves the setting `expandableRow` to true. In addition a row template should be provided via an id that points to the `expandableRowTemplate` which is a `template` element. You can preset the expandable state by adding `rowExpanded: true` to the row element you want to expand. The default is collapsed.\n\nHere is a code example for an expandable row\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid\n    id=\"data-grid-expandable-row\"\n    expandable-row=\"true\"\n    expandable-row-template=\"expandable-row-tmpl\"\n    label=\"Books\">\n    <template id=\"expandable-row-tmpl\">\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"span\">${convention}</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">${price} USD</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">Lorem Ipsum is simply sample text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard sample text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only...</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n    </template>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to expandable rows\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `expandableRowTemplate` {string} Should point to the row `template` element.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe Editing features start by setting `editable` to true. In addition you should add editors to columns and enable features of each of the editors. The features differ depending on the component used for editing. See the Keyboard section for information on which keys can be used when editing..\n\nHere is a code example for an editable text cell.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n    id: 'description',\n    name: 'Description',\n    field: 'description',\n    sortable: true,\n    resizable: true,\n    reorderable: true,\n    formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n    editor: {\n      type: 'input',\n      inline: true,\n      editorSettings: {\n        autoselect: true,\n        dirtyTracker: true\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nHere is a code example for an editable dropdown cell\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'description',\n  name: 'Description',\n  field: 'description',\n  resizable: true,\n  reorderable: true,\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.dropdown,\n  editor: {\n    type: 'dropdown',\n    editorSettings: {\n      dirtyTracker: true,\n      validate: 'required',\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Option 1',\n          value: 'opt1'\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Option 2',\n          value: 'opt2'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo cancel or disabled editing there are a few ways:\n\n- setting the column `editor` setting to undefined will disable editing on the column (as will not having an editor setting at all).\n- adding a `readonly` or `disabled` function which returned true for some cells based on a condition will disable or mark the cell readonly.\n- return false in the `beforecelledit` event in the response function\n\nThe following settings are available on editors.\n\n`type` As of now can be `checkbox`, `input`, `datepicker`, `timepicker`, or `dropdown` but more will be added.\n`inline` Default is false. If true the editor (for example an input) will be visible in a field.\n`editorSettings` Is an object that is loosely typed that lets you pass any option the editor supports in. For example any of the IdsInput or IdsCheckbox options can be passing in. Some special ones are:\n`editorSettings.autoselect` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.dirtyTracker` Enables the dirty tracker that marks changed cells.\n`editorSettings.validate` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.mask` Will pass mask settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.maskOptions` Will pass maskOptions settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.options` Dataset used for dropdown editor's list box options.\n\nWhen the use clicks in the cell or activates editing with the keyboard with the Enter key and types. The following events will fire.\n\n`beforecelledit` Fires before a cell is being edit (before edit is started). Can be vetoed by returning false as shown below.\n`celledit` Fires exactly when a cell is being edited.\n`endcelledit` Fires when a cell edit is completed and changed.\n`cancelcelledit` Fires when an edit is cancelled via the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.\n\nTo cancel editing based on some condition or if editing is not allowed you can veto the `beforecelledit` event.\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('beforecelledit', (e: Event) => {\n    (<CustomEvent>e).detail.response(false);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions for editing the data grid mentioned in the Methods section.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\nWhen used as an attribute in the DOM the settings are kebab case, when used in JS they are camel case.\n\n- `virtualScroll` {boolean} When virtual scroll is used the grid can render many thousands of rows and only the rows visible in the scroll area are rendered for performance.

Each column in the grid should have some unique id.|\n|`name` | {string} | The text to show on the header.|\n|`field` | {string} | The name of the field (column) in the data array attached to the grid for example `description`. This can also be nested in an object for example `children.name`. |\n|`sortable` | {boolean} | If false, the column cannot be sorted. When completed a `sorted` event will fire.|\n|`resizable` | {boolean} | If false the column will not be resizable, thus is a fixed size and can never be changed by the user by dragging the left and right edge.  When completed a `columnresized` event will fire. See the `columns-resizable` example for a working example. |\n|`reorderable` | {boolean} | If true the column can be dragged into another position with adjacent columns. When completed a `columnmoved` event will fire. See the `columns-reorderable` example for a working example. This currently does not work with grouped columns. |\n|`readonly` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to readonly color, indicating no editing.|\n|`disabled` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to disabled color, indicating no editing.|\n|`formatter`| {Function} | Controls how the data is rendered in the cell.|\n|`hidden` | {boolean} | Excludes the column from being added to the DOM.|\n|`align` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align both the cell and the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`headerAlign` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align just the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`minWidth` | {number} | The minimum width used to prevent resizing a column below this size. |\n|`maxWidth` | {number} | The maximum width used to prevent resizing a column above this size. |\n|`cssPart` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of a css part that can be used to customize the cell's css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example. The default cssPart for cells is called `cell` and it also can be used for more global changes.  |\n|`frozen` | {string} | Sets the column to be frozen on either left or right side by passing `left` or `right`. See the `columns-frozen` example for a working example. Frozen columns currently have some limitations to be addressed in the future. |<!--lint disable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`width` | {number or string} | The column width, this can be an integer for fixed pixel width or a percent for example `10%`, if left off the columns will be sized to contents and to fit the width of the grid using the css table browsers handling (this is known as `auto` columns). I.E. There are three column configurations: `auto`, `fixed` and `percent`. <br /><br />In addition one can specify any css grid column setting like `fr` or `ch`. In order to make what was called a `stretchColumn` in previous versions you can set the width to`minmax(130px, 4fr)`. This is some minimum width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (see example columns-stretch.html). For a spacer column you just need to specify one extra column at the end (see example columns-fixed.html) but this is not recommended for how it looks. |<!--lint enable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`headerIcon` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of the header icon. |\n|`tooltipOptions` | {Object or Function} | Allows you to set the tooltip options. See the tooltip example. |\n|`tooltip` | {string or Function} | Let you set the tooltip content. |\n|`headerTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header title tooltip content. |\n|`headerIconTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header icon tooltip content. |\n|`filterButtonTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header filter button tooltip content. |\n|`tooltipCssPart` | {string or Function} | Allows you to set the name of a tooltip css part that can be used to customize the tooltip css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example.\n|`headerTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header tooltip css part.\n|`headerIconTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header icon tooltip css part.\n|`filterButtonTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the filter button tooltip css part.\n|`cellSelectedCssPart` | {string} | Allows customization of a selected cell's background color.\n|`editor` | {object} | Adds an editor to the column if editable is set on the grid. See editing section for more details.\n\n## Column Settings (Specific)\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`href` | {string|Function} | Used to create the href for hyperlink formatters. This can be a string or a function that can work dynamically. It can also replace `{{value}}` with the current value. |\n|`text` | {string} | Used to create the txt value for hyperlink formatters if a hard coded link text is needed. |\n|`disabled` | {boolean|Function} | Sets the cell contents to disabled, can also use a callback to determine this dynamically. Only checkboxes, radios, buttons and link columns can be disabled at this time. Selection columns require disabled rows in order to not be clickable/selectable. |\n\n## Formatters\n\n|Formatter|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | (Default) Formats the column value as a direct text element using toString in the grid cell.

The idea behind the formatter is it takes the cell value and does processing on it to return the correct markup for the cell. The simplest custom formatter would be this example.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'custom',\n  name: 'Custom',\n  field: 'price',\n  formatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n    const value = `Custom: ${rowData[columnData.field] || '0'}`;\n    return `<span class=\"text-ellipsis\">${value}</span>`;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo style a custom formatter you may need to add a css part for the element. For example:\n\n```js\nformatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n  const value = `${rowData[columnData.field] || ''}`;\n  return `<a part=\"custom-link\" href=\"#\" class=\"text-ellipsis\">${escapeHTML(value)}</a>`;\n},\n```\n\nThen in the style sheet you add for you page you put the styles.\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link) {\n  color: #da1217;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link):hover {\n  color: #6c080b;\n}\n```\n\nThe formatter is then linked via the column on the formatter setting. When the grid cell is rendered the formatter function is called and the following arguments are passed in.\n\n- `rowData` The current row's data from the data array.\n- `columnData` The column object with all of the column configuration for this cell.\n\n## Events\n\n- `activecellchanged` Fires when the active cell changes with the keyboard or by click.\n- `sorted` Fires when the sort column is changed.\n- `selectionchanged` Fires any time the selection changes.\n- `activationchanged` Fires any time the active row changes.\n- `rowselected` Fires for each row that is selected.\n- `rowdeselected` Fires for each row that is deselected.\n- `rowactivated` Fires for each row that is activated.\n- `rowdeactivated` Fires for each row that is deactivated.\n- `rowclick` Fires for each row that is clicked.\n- `dblclick` Fires each time double clicked on body cells or header cells. Based on where it clicked details can be capture like `type: 'body-cell'|'header-title'|'header-filter'` etc.\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n- `columnresized` Fires when a column is resized or setColumnWidth is called.\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `rowExpanded` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `rowCollapsed` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called.\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `beforemenushow` Fires before context menu show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `menushow` Fires after context menu show.\n- `menuselected` Fires after context menu item selected.\n- `settingschanged` Fires after settings are changed in some way.\n- `scrollstart` Fires when data-grid reaches the topmost row.\n- `scrollend` Fires when data-grid reaches the bottommost row.\n\n## Methods\n\n- `setColumnWidth` Can be used to set the width of a column.\n- `setColumnVisibility` Can be used to set the visibility of a column.\n- `setActivateCell(cell, row)` Can be used to set focus of a cell.\n- `selectedRows` Lists the indexes of the currently selected rows.\n- `saveSetting(setting: string)` Save the given setting to local storage.\n- `saveAllSettings` Save all user settings to local storage.\n- `savedSetting(setting: string)` Get saved given setting value from local storage.\n- `allSavedSettings` Get saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `clearSetting(setting: string, key?: string)` Clear the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `clearAllSettings(userKeys: unknown)` Clear saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `restoreSetting(setting: string, value?: unknown)` Restore the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `editFirstCell` Puts the first cell on the active row into edit mode.\n- `appendData(data: Record<string, unknown>)` Use this to add more data to the datagrid's existing dataset.  This will automatically render additional rows in the datagrid.\n- `addRow(data: Record<string, unknown>, index?: number)` Adds a new row at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `addRows(data: Array<Record<string, unknown>>, index?: number)` Adds multiple new rows at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `removeRow(index: number)` Removed the provided row index from the dataset and visual datagrid\n- `clearRow(index: number)` Clears all values on the given row.\n- `commitCellEdit` Stops editing and commits the value in the active editor.\n- `cancelCellEdit` Stops editing and reverts the value in the active editor.\n- `resetDirtyCells` Clears all dirty cell indicators.\n- `dirtyCells` Gives a list of all currently dirty cells.\n- `exoprtToExcel(format: 'csv' | 'xlsx', filename: string, keepGridFormatting: boolean)` Export datagrid datasource to an excel file. This keeps grid formatting by default.\n\n## Filters\n\nData rows can be filter based on one or several criteria. Whole filter row can turned on/off by the api setting `filterable` and can be disabled by the api setting `filter-row-disabled`. The filter conditions can be applied thru the UI or programmatically. Each column can have its own filter type and turn on/off by columns setting.\n\n### Filter Columns Setting\n\nAll the filter settings can be passed thru columns data.\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`filterType` | Function | Data grid built-in filter method, see the dedicated section below. |\n|`filterConditions` | Array | List of items to be use as operators in menu-button or options in dropdown. |\n|`filterFunction` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. |\n|`filterOptions` | Object | Setting for components are in use, for example: `label, placeholder, disabled`. |\n|`isChecked` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. This method use along built-in `checkbox` only, when filter data value is not boolean type. |\n\n### Built-in Filter Methods\n\n|Method|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | It filter as text comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`integer` | It filter as integer comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`decimal` | It filter as decimal comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`contents` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and auto generate list of items based on column data. |\n|`dropdown` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and must pass list of item by setting `filterConditions`. |\n|`checkbox` | It filter as boolean comparison. Contains menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`date` | It filter as date comparison. Contains date-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`time` | It filter as time comparison. Contains time-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n\n### Custom Filter\n\nIf the built-in filters are not enough, creating a custom filter is an option. There are two parts you can create both parts custom or mix-match with built-in.\n\n1. `UI Only` In order to do custom UI part of filter, add as html markup thru a slot. It must use slot and column-id attributes for example: `<div slot=\"filter-n\" column-id=\"n\">...</div>` where n is the columnId same passed in the columns.\n1. `filterFunction` This is a user defined filter method which must return a boolean. It determines if a cell value should be considered as a valid filtered value.\n1. `disableClientFilter` This is an api setting to disable filter logic client side. It will set filter conditions and fire an event `filtered` which can listen for custom logic.\n\n### Filter Code Examples\n\nBasic text filters\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"

id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" disable-client-filter=\"true\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n  filterType: dataGrid.filters.text\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('filtered', (e: any) => {\n  console.info('filtered:', e.detail);\n});\n```\n\n### Filter rows programmatically\n\n```js\n// Filter rows\nconst conditions = [{ columnId: 'description', operator: 'contains', value: '5' }];\ndataGrid.applyFilter(conditions);\n\n// Reset all filters\ndataGrid.applyFilter([]);\n```\n\n### Filter Events\n\nThe following events are relevant to data-grid filters.\n\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n\n## Custom cell colors\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to customize the background color of cells.  This can be done with the `cssPart` column setting:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell'\n});\n```\n\nThe `cssPart` property is translated into a `part` attribute that is applied to every cell in the column.  In the event the color needs to be conditional based on the row index or other logic, a function can be used:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nAfter this is defined, accompanying CSS can be written to target the parts `custom-cell`, `custom-cell-1`, and `custom-cell-2` to change background color or other CSS properties of the cell:\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(cell) {\n  background-color: #ebf9f1;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(cell-selected) {\n  background-color: #c9dad0;\n}\n```\n\n### Changing selected cell colors\n\nAnother column setting, `cellSelectedCssPart` can be used alongside `cssPart` to customize the selected color of the row in a similar way.  When using `mixed` selection, this color is also applied to activated rows:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell',\n  cellSelectedCssPart: 'custom-cell-selected'\n});\n```\n\nThis column setting can also be a function, just like `cssPart`:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2'),\n  cellSelectedCssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-selected-1' : 'custom-cell-selected-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Tooltip Code Examples\n\nSet suppress tooltips to turn off.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" suppress-tooltips>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\nSet custom tooltip strings.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: 'This is a product Id',\n  headerTooltip: 'This is the product Id header title',\n  headerIconTooltip: 'This is product Id header icon',\n  filterButtonTooltip: 'This is the product Id filterButton'\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip as callback.\n\n```js\nconst tooltipCallback = (args: any): string => {\n  const { type, columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>Header Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>FilterButton Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell:

columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return { headerPlacement: 'top', headerX: 0, headerY: 10 };\n  } else if (type === 'header-icon') {\n    return { headerIconPlacement: 'top', headerIconX: 0, headerIconY: 10 };\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return { filterButtonPlacement: 'bottom', filterButtonX: 0, filterButtonY: 22 };\n  }\n  return { placement: 'top', x: 0, y: 10 };\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipOptions: tooltipOptionsCallback\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip custom css.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  headerTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  headerIconTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  filterButtonTooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise'\n});\n```\n```css\n/* tooltip css part `custom-turquoise`

css part each time, for `body-cell` tooltips\n  if (type === 'body-cell') {\n    const parts = ['azure', 'ruby'];\n    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * parts.length);\n    cssPart = parts[randomIndex];\n  }\n  return cssPart;\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipCssPart: tooltipCssPartCallback\n});\n```\n```css\n/* tooltip css part `azure` */\nids-data-grid::part(azure-tooltip-arrow-top)::after {\n  border-top-color:

Filtered\n\n**Cells**\n- Hover (sometimes a cursor change)\n- Readonly\n- Focus\n- Checked/Not Checked (Checkboxes)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd>The initial tab enters the grid with focus on the first cell of the first row, often a header. A second tab moves out of the grid to the next tab stop on the page. Once focus is established in the grid, a TAB into or a Shift Tab into the grid will return to the cell which last had focus. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the next cell.\n- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> Moves the reverse of tab. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the previous cell.\n- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent column's cell. There is no wrap at the end or beginning of columns.\n- <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent row's cell. There is no wrap at the first or last row.\n- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves focus to the first cell of the current row\n- <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the last cell of the current row\n- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> moves focus to the first cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> moves focus to the last cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggles selection the activate row. If suppressRowDeselection is set it will be ignored on deselect. If the cell contains an expandable element then the row will toggle the expanded state. If the cell contains a checkbox editor, will toggle the checkbox state.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> toggles actionable mode. Pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key while in actionable mode moves focus to the next actionable cell. While in actionable mode you can do things like type + enter. This will move you down a row when you hit enter. If the cell has a control that uses down arrow (like the drop downs or lookups that are editable). Then the user needs to hit enter to enable the edit mode on that cell.\n- <kbd>Triple Click</kbd> Not a keyboard shortcut, but if you have text in a cell that is overflowed a triple click will select all the text even the part that is invisible.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> Activates edit mode on the cell if it is editable. There is also an \"auto edit detection\". If the user starts typing then edit mode will happen automatically without enter. If in edit mode already <kbd>Enter</kbd> will finish edit mode. If `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in next row.\n- <kbd>Shift + Enter</kbd> Same as enter but if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in previous row.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter. But if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled, will stay in same cell. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n- <kbd>CMD/CTRL + Enter</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter.\n- <kbd>ESC</kbd> Revert to the previous value and cancel editing. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- By default, data grid grows depending on the amount of contents within and will scroll if necessary under the header. It stops growing when it reaches the size of the parent container.\n- `autoFit` property or `auto-fit` attribute can be set manually to make the data grid size fill and be responsive to the size of the screen, regardless of the amount of contents.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Counts have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Data grid has all new markup and a custom element but some similarly named options\n- Still uses same columns and data set options. Some column options enhanced and changed.\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example: sorted, rendered\n- Some Api Functions have changed\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes or as plain properties for example: data, virtual-scroll\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-data-grid></ids-data-grid>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- `Drill Down` Formatter is now covered by `Button` formatter with `icon=\"drilldown\"`\n- `textOverflow` setting is now by default\n- `rowNavigation` setting has replaced `cellNavigation`. Cell navigation is the default behavior.\n- `stretchColumn` is now more flexible and can be achieved by setting a column width to `minmax(130px, 4fr)`. I.E. some min width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (or similar variations).\n- split columns are not supported anymore but could be done with a custom formatter if needed\n- `frozenColumns` setting is now set on each column by adding `frozen: 'left'` or `frozen: 'right'` to the column definition.\n- Some events are renamed see the events section for more details, also the signature of the events has changed.\n- Custom formatter functions can now be any type of function and have a different signature.\n- The `expanded` column option for tree was renamed to `rowExpanded`.\n- The `expandrow/collapserow` events are renamed to `rowexpanded/rowcollapsed`\n- The `beforeentereditmode/entereditmode/exiteditmode` event is renamed to `beforecelledit/celledit/endcelledit/cancelcelledit`\n- The `actionablemode` feature has been replaced with simply tabbing to the next editable field when in edit mode.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n1.1.1 Non-text Content - All images, links and icons have text labels for screen readers when the formatters are used.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and links and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.\n- 2.1.1 Keyboard - Make all functionality available from a keyboard. The grid has keyboard shortcuts and is usable with a screen reader due to the addition of aria tags.\n- A datagrid in general including this one uses the following aria tags\n  - `aria-label` labels the enter table on the main table\n  - `aria-rowcount` lists the visible row count on the main table\n  - `aria-colindex` the index of each column on the column elements\n  - `aria-rwindex` the index of each row on the row elements\n  - `aria-setsize` for tree grid lists the number of elements in each level (group)\n  - `aria-level` the level of indentation\n  - `aria-posinset` the depth into each set\n  - `aria-expanded` on the row it indicates if the row is expanded (for tree and expandable row)\n  - `aria-sort` indicates the sort direction on the sortable columns\n  - `aria-checked` indicates if the element is checked on checkbox columns and headers\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles and labels should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Code Separation (For Developers)\n\nThe code is divided into several files. Here is a description of where everything is.\n\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.ts` creates a non-shadow root `ids-data-grid-cell`, and handles its own selection, and activation.\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-cell` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-contextmenu.ts` contains code in the form of export functions, that adds ability to get right click menus on headers and cells\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.scss` contains all css related to the filter row and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.ts` contains code to implement the filtering functionality and its ui (some functions are in ids-data-source)\n- `ids-data-grid-formatters.ts` contains all formatter functions and some supporting code like data extraction\n- `ids-data-grid-header.ts` contains most header functionality, the header template, and code related to header actions like sort, reorder and selection.\n- `ids-data-grid-header.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-header` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-row.ts` contains most row functionality, the row template, and code related to row actions like expand, collapse, select, activate\n- `ids-data-grid-row.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-row` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-tooltip-mixin.js` contains a tooltip mixin that adds tooltip functionality to cells and headers, its different from `ids-tooltip-mixin` (more specific)\n- `ids-data-grid.js` contains all main data grid code, the api and settings and the main generator loop for the data grid\n"

        "value": "# Ids Data Grid\n\n## Description\n\nThe data grid component (ids-data-grid) is used to arrange tabular data in rows and columns for easier scanning and comparison. Data grids are very configurable in both design and functionality and they can be found within almost every product/app.\n\nYou should pass an array of objects in to the grid on the `dataset` object. Also pass the `columns` array which contains the column configuration. There are a number of events described in the events and API section, as well as the column settings.\n\nA Read-Only data grid uses \"Formatters\" to render cell content. A number of these are listed in the API section and it is possible to create your own.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- The data grid component is most useful when it is used for categorically sorting dense and repetitive information. Each individual item is listed down the Y axis of the chart, and their shared attribute categories are listed along the X axis. The resulting cells are filled with information that is relevant to the corresponding item and attribute.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Title**: The name of the data grid optionally appearing above the grid and describing the contents.\n- **Options**: An optionally actions menu button with functionality that operates on the entire data grid.\n- **Cell**: Body elements of the data grid that contain an object's value or attribute. Cells should only contain one type of content or it can be confusing and hurt accessibility.\n- **Header Cell**: These cells contain the names of the columns in the grid and related functions like filtering and sorting. All cells below the header cell will hold values related to the attribute in the header cell.\n- **Column**: Cells stacked vertically that contain values relate to the attribute found on the top header cell.\n- **Row**: Each row contains one cell per column in the data grid, and each cell displays a single value in the bound data item.\n- **Tree**: Denotes the use of hierarchical data, with an expandable and collapsible hierarchy.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `table` allows you to further style the table main element\n- `container` allows you to further style the container element\n- `body` allows you to further style the body element\n- `header` allows you to further style the header element\n- `headerCell` allows you to further style the header cells\n- `row` allows you to further style the rows\n- `cell` allows you to further style the row cells\n- `cell-selected` allows you to further style row cells that are selected (in mixed-selection mode, activated cells are also styled)\n- `tooltip-popup` allows you to further style or adjust the outer tooltip popup element\n- `tooltip-arrow` allows you to adjust the tooltip arrow element\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA data grid is created by adding an `ids-data-grid` html element in the page and setting the options either inline in the markup or in the JS part of the code. You can only use simple types (string, boolean ect) for inline markup so passing the data and column arrangement is always done in the JS part. The data will be an array of objects so its in the correct tabular form. The columns are also an array of objects but with defined options and types. See more about columns in next section.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\nconst dataGrid = document.querySelector('#data-grid-1');\ndataGrid.data = dataset;\ndataGrid.columns = columns;\n```\n\n### Column Groups\n\nSetting column groups allows you to add a second level of columns in your header and the ability to group the first level. This is useful for when you have a large number of columns and you want to group them into logical or related sections.\n\nColumn groups are achieved by providing an array to the `columnGroups` setting. Only one level of column groups can be defined.\n\n```js\ndataGrid.columnGroups = [\n{\n  colspan: 3,\n  id: 'group1',\n  name: 'Column Group One',\n  align: 'center'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group2',\n  name: 'Column Group Two'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 2,\n  id: 'group3',\n  name: 'Column Group Three',\n  align: 'right'\n},\n{\n  colspan: 11,\n  id: 'group4',\n  name: 'Column Group Four',\n  align: 'left'\n}\n];\n```\n\nIf the column is hidden it will be automatically removed from the `colspan`. If in the last group you didn't provided a bug enough `colspan` it will be set to the remaining columns. The `name` text can be right or left aligned and given an id. The only required property is `colspan`.\n\n### Selection\n\nThe data grid selection feature involves the setting `rowSelection`. This can be one of several values.\n\n- `false` No selection enabled.\n- `multiple` Allows multiple rows to be selected. When doing this it is recommended to add a `formatters.selectionCheckbox` for the first column.\n- `single` Allows a single row to be selected. When doing this you can optionally to add a `formatters.selectionRadio` for the first column. You can use the `suppressRowDeselection` if you want one row to always be selected.\n- `mixed` Allows multiple rows to be selected by clicking only on the checkbox or <kbd>Space</kbd> key. If clicking a row then that row is activated, meaning it is the current row and something might be shown based on the data of that row. You can use the `suppressRowDeactivation` if you want one row to always be selected.\n\nHere is a code example for multi select\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" row-selection=\"multiple\">\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Selected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('rowdeselected', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Row Deselected`, e.detail);\n  });\n\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('selectionchanged', (e) => {\n    console.info(`Selection Changed`, e.detail);\n  });\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowselected` Fires when an individual row is activation and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeselected` Fires when an individual row is deselected and gives information about that row.\n`selectionchanged` Fires once for each time selection changes and gives information about all selected rows.\n\n`rowactivated` Fires when an individual row is activated and gives information about that row.\n`rowdeactivated` Fires when an individual row is deactivated and gives information about that row.\n`activationchanged` Fires once for each time activation changes and gives information about the active row.\n\n### Tree Grid\n\nThe tree grid feature involves the setting `treeGrid` to true. In addition the data passed to the tree grid should contain a field called `children`. That contains the child rows. This can by unlimited levels but 2-4 is recommended as a max for a more usable UI. In addition you can preset some states by adding `rowExpanded: false` to the parent elements (default is expanded). And also set `rowHidden: false` for child rows that are expanded. You also need a `Expander` formatter on a cell (usually the first visible cell.\n\nHere is a code example for a tree grid.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"tree-grid\" label=\"Buildings\" tree-grid=\"true\" group-selects-children=\"true\"></ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to selection/activation.\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `groupSelectsChildren` {boolean} If the tree grid has multiple selection, setting this will select all children when a parent is selected.\n- `suppressRowClickSelection` {boolean} If using selection you might want to set this so clicking a row will not select it.\n### Expandable Row\n\nThe Expandable Row feature involves the setting `expandableRow` to true. In addition a row template should be provided via an id that points to the `expandableRowTemplate` which is a `template` element. You can preset the expandable state by adding `rowExpanded: true` to the row element you want to expand. The default is collapsed.\n\nHere is a code example for an expandable row\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid\n    id=\"data-grid-expandable-row\"\n    expandable-row=\"true\"\n    expandable-row-template=\"expandable-row-tmpl\"\n    label=\"Books\">\n    <template id=\"expandable-row-tmpl\">\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"16\" type=\"span\">${convention}</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">${price} USD</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n        <ids-layout-grid auto-fit=\"true\" padding-x=\"md\">\n        <ids-text font-size=\"14\" type=\"span\">Lorem Ipsum is simply sample text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard sample text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only...</ids-text>\n        </ids-layout-grid>\n    </template>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\n```js\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowexpanded', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Expanded`, e.detail);\n});\n\ndataGrid.addEventListener('rowcollapsed', (e) => {\n  console.info(`Row Collapsed`, e.detail);\n});\n```\n\nThe following events are relevant to expandable rows\n\n`rowexpanded` Fires when a tree grid row is expanded by click or keyboard.\n`rowcollapsed` Fires when a tree grid row is collapsed by click or keyboard.\n\nSome additional settings are needed or possibly needed.\n\n- `idColumn` {string} For saving the row state during sort this should be set to the id column in the data set. Defaults to `id`.\n- `expandableRowTemplate` {string} Should point to the row `template` element.\n\n### Editing\n\nThe Editing features start by setting `editable` to true. In addition you should add editors to columns and enable features of each of the editors. The features differ depending on the component used for editing. See the Keyboard section for information on which keys can be used when editing..\n\nHere is a code example for an editable text cell.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n    id: 'description',\n    name: 'Description',\n    field: 'description',\n    sortable: true,\n    resizable: true,\n    reorderable: true,\n    formatter: dataGrid.formatters.text,\n    editor: {\n      type: 'input',\n      inline: true,\n      editorSettings: {\n        autoselect: true,\n        dirtyTracker: true\n      }\n    }\n  });\n```\n\nHere is a code example for an editable dropdown cell\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'description',\n  name: 'Description',\n  field: 'description',\n  resizable: true,\n  reorderable: true,\n  formatter: dataGrid.formatters.dropdown,\n  editor: {\n    type: 'dropdown',\n    editorSettings: {\n      dirtyTracker: true,\n      validate: 'required',\n      options: [\n        {\n          label: 'Option 1',\n          value: 'opt1'\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Option 2',\n          value: 'opt2'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo cancel or disabled editing there are a few ways:\n\n- setting the column `editor` setting to undefined will disable editing on the column (as will not having an editor setting at all).\n- adding a `readonly` or `disabled` function which returned true for some cells based on a condition will disable or mark the cell readonly.\n- return false in the `beforecelledit` event in the response function\n\nThe following settings are available on editors.\n\n`type` As of now can be `checkbox`, `input`, `datepicker`, `timepicker`, or `dropdown` but more will be added.\n`inline` Default is false. If true the editor (for example an input) will be visible in a field.\n`editorSettings` Is an object that is loosely typed that lets you pass any option the editor supports in. For example any of the IdsInput or IdsCheckbox options can be passing in. Some special ones are:\n`editorSettings.autoselect` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.dirtyTracker` Enables the dirty tracker that marks changed cells.\n`editorSettings.validate` Text will be selected when entering edit mode\n`editorSettings.mask` Will pass mask settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.maskOptions` Will pass maskOptions settings to the input (if supported).\n`editorSettings.options` Dataset used for dropdown editor's list box options.\n\nWhen the use clicks in the cell or activates editing with the keyboard with the Enter key and types. The following events will fire.\n\n`beforecelledit` Fires before a cell is being edit (before edit is started). Can be vetoed by returning false as shown below.\n`celledit` Fires exactly when a cell is being edited.\n`endcelledit` Fires when a cell edit is completed and changed.\n`cancelcelledit` Fires when an edit is cancelled via the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key.\n\nTo cancel editing based on some condition or if editing is not allowed you can veto the `beforecelledit` event.\n\n```js\n  dataGrid.addEventListener('beforecelledit', (e: Event) => {\n    (<CustomEvent>e).detail.response(false);\n  });\n```\n\nThere are a few utility functions for editing the data grid mentioned in the Methods section.\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\nWhen used as an attribute in the DOM the settings are kebab case, when used in JS they are camel case.\n\n- `virtualScroll` {boolean} When virtual scroll is used the grid can render many thousands of rows and only the rows visible in the scroll area are rendered for performance.

Each column in the grid should have some unique id.|\n|`name` | {string} | The text to show on the header.|\n|`field` | {string} | The name of the field (column) in the data array attached to the grid for example `description`. This can also be nested in an object for example `children.name`. |\n|`sortable` | {boolean} | If false, the column cannot be sorted. When completed a `sorted` event will fire.|\n|`resizable` | {boolean} | If false the column will not be resizable, thus is a fixed size and can never be changed by the user by dragging the left and right edge.  When completed a `columnresized` event will fire. See the `columns-resizable` example for a working example. |\n|`reorderable` | {boolean} | If true the column can be dragged into another position with adjacent columns. When completed a `columnmoved` event will fire. See the `columns-reorderable` example for a working example. This currently does not work with grouped columns. |\n|`readonly` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to readonly color, indicating no editing.|\n|`disabled` | {boolean or Function} | If true the cell will be set to disabled color, indicating no editing.|\n|`formatter`| {Function} | Controls how the data is rendered in the cell.|\n|`hidden` | {boolean} | Excludes the column from being added to the DOM.|\n|`align` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align both the cell and the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`headerAlign` | {string} | Can be `left` or `right` or `center` to align just the header. Left is the default so does not need to be specified. |\n|`minWidth` | {number} | The minimum width used to prevent resizing a column below this size. |\n|`maxWidth` | {number} | The maximum width used to prevent resizing a column above this size. |\n|`cssPart` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of a css part that can be used to customize the cell's css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example. The default cssPart for cells is called `cell` and it also can be used for more global changes.  |\n|`frozen` | {string} | Sets the column to be frozen on either left or right side by passing `left` or `right`. See the `columns-frozen` example for a working example. Frozen columns currently have some limitations to be addressed in the future. |<!--lint disable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`width` | {number or string} | The column width, this can be an integer for fixed pixel width or a percent for example `10%`, if left off the columns will be sized to contents and to fit the width of the grid using the css table browsers handling (this is known as `auto` columns). I.E. There are three column configurations: `auto`, `fixed` and `percent`. <br /><br />In addition one can specify any css grid column setting like `fr` or `ch`. In order to make what was called a `stretchColumn` in previous versions you can set the width to`minmax(130px, 4fr)`. This is some minimum width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (see example columns-stretch.html). For a spacer column you just need to specify one extra column at the end (see example columns-fixed.html) but this is not recommended for how it looks. |<!--lint enable maximum-line-length definition-case-->\n|`headerIcon` | {string} | Allows you to set the name of the header icon. |\n|`tooltipOptions` | {Object or Function} | Allows you to set the tooltip options. See the tooltip example. |\n|`tooltip` | {string or Function} | Let you set the tooltip content. |\n|`headerTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header title tooltip content. |\n|`headerIconTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header icon tooltip content. |\n|`filterButtonTooltip` | {string} | Let you set the header filter button tooltip content. |\n|`tooltipCssPart` | {string or Function} | Allows you to set the name of a tooltip css part that can be used to customize the tooltip css. This can be a string or a function. See the columns-custom-css example.\n|`headerTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header tooltip css part.\n|`headerIconTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the header icon tooltip css part.\n|`filterButtonTooltipCssPart` | {string} | Allows you to sets the filter button tooltip css part.\n|`cellSelectedCssPart` | {string} | Allows customization of a selected cell's background color.\n|`editor` | {object} | Adds an editor to the column if editable is set on the grid. See editing section for more details.\n\n## Column Settings (Specific)\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`href` | {string|Function} | Used to create the href for hyperlink formatters. This can be a string or a function that can work dynamically. It can also replace `{{value}}` with the current value. |\n|`text` | {string} | Used to create the txt value for hyperlink formatters if a hard coded link text is needed. |\n|`disabled` | {boolean|Function} | Sets the cell contents to disabled, can also use a callback to determine this dynamically. Only checkboxes, radios, buttons and link columns can be disabled at this time. Selection columns require disabled rows in order to not be clickable/selectable. |\n\n## Formatters\n\n|Formatter|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | (Default) Formats the column value as a direct text element using toString in the grid cell. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty.|\n|`password` | Formats the column value masking the string length with stars. Undefined or Null values will be shown as empty. This is good for private data. |\n|`rowNumber` | Formats the cell with a row number column that is shown 1 to n no matter what the sort order is. |\n|`date` | Formats date data as a date string in the desired format, by default it will use `dateStyle: 'short'` for other options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions` |\n|`time` | Formats date data as a time string in the desired format, by default it will use `timeStyle: 'short'` for other options you can pass them in with `column.formatOptions` |\n|`decimal` | Formats number data as a decimal string in the specified locale.

Other column settings like `type` can be used to set the button type as can `icon` by set for icon only buttons. Use the `click` setting/function to get an callback handler. |\n| `hyperlink` | Displays an `ids-hyperlink`. Other column settings like `href` can be used to set the link href and `text` can be used to set the text to specific text. Use the `click` setting/function to get an callback handler. |\n| `checkbox` | Displays an `ids-checkbox`. The value will be checked depending on if the attached field is true or `\"true\"`. |\n| `badge` | Displays an `ids-badge`. The associated field will be placed in the badge.

The idea behind the formatter is it takes the cell value and does processing on it to return the correct markup for the cell. The simplest custom formatter would be this example.\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'custom',\n  name: 'Custom',\n  field: 'price',\n  formatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n    const value = `Custom: ${rowData[columnData.field] || '0'}`;\n    return `<span class=\"text-ellipsis\">${value}</span>`;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo style a custom formatter you may need to add a css part for the element. For example:\n\n```js\nformatter: (rowData: Record<string, unknown>, columnData: Record<string, any>) => {\n  const value = `${rowData[columnData.field] || ''}`;\n  return `<a part=\"custom-link\" href=\"#\" class=\"text-ellipsis\">${escapeHTML(value)}</a>`;\n},\n```\n\nThen in the style sheet you add for you page you put the styles.\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link) {\n  color: #da1217;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(custom-link):hover {\n  color: #6c080b;\n}\n```\n\nThe formatter is then linked via the column on the formatter setting. When the grid cell is rendered the formatter function is called and the following arguments are passed in.\n\n- `rowData` The current row's data from the data array.\n- `columnData` The column object with all of the column configuration for this cell.\n\n## Events\n\n- `activecellchanged` Fires when the active cell changes with the keyboard or by click.\n- `sorted` Fires when the sort column is changed.\n- `selectionchanged` Fires any time the selection changes.\n- `activationchanged` Fires any time the active row changes.\n- `rowselected` Fires for each row that is selected.\n- `rowdeselected` Fires for each row that is deselected.\n- `rowactivated` Fires for each row that is activated.\n- `rowdeactivated` Fires for each row that is deactivated.\n- `rowclick` Fires for each row that is clicked.\n- `dblclick` Fires each time double clicked on body cells or header cells. Based on where it clicked details can be capture like `type: 'body-cell'|'header-title'|'header-filter'` etc.\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n- `columnresized` Fires when a column is resized or setColumnWidth is called.\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `rowExpanded` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `rowCollapsed` Fires when a tree or expandable row is expanded or collapsed\n- `columnmoved` Fires when a column is moved / reordered or moveColumn is called.\n- `beforetooltipshow` Fires before tooltip show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `beforemenushow` Fires before context menu show, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `menushow` Fires after context menu show.\n- `menuselected` Fires after context menu item selected.\n- `settingschanged` Fires after settings are changed in some way.\n- `scrollstart` Fires when data-grid reaches the topmost row.\n- `scrollend` Fires when data-grid reaches the bottommost row.\n\n## Methods\n\n- `setColumnWidth` Can be used to set the width of a column.\n- `setColumnVisibility` Can be used to set the visibility of a column.\n- `setActivateCell(cell, row)` Can be used to set focus of a cell.\n- `selectedRows` Lists the indexes of the currently selected rows.\n- `saveSetting(setting: string)` Save the given setting to local storage.\n- `saveAllSettings` Save all user settings to local storage.\n- `savedSetting(setting: string)` Get saved given setting value from local storage.\n- `allSavedSettings` Get saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `clearSetting(setting: string, key?: string)` Clear the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `clearAllSettings(userKeys: unknown)` Clear saved all user settings from local storage.\n- `restoreSetting(setting: string, value?: unknown)` Restore the given saved setting from local storage.\n- `editFirstCell` Puts the first cell on the active row into edit mode.\n- `appendData(data: Record<string, unknown>)` Use this to add more data to the datagrid's existing dataset.  This will automatically render additional rows in the datagrid.\n- `addRow(data: Record<string, unknown>, index?: number)` Adds a new row at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `addRows(data: Array<Record<string, unknown>>, index?: number)` Adds multiple new rows at optional row index and defaults the values to all those provided in the data\n- `removeRow(index: number)` Removed the provided row index from the dataset and visual datagrid\n- `clearRow(index: number)` Clears all values on the given row.\n- `commitCellEdit` Stops editing and commits the value in the active editor.\n- `cancelCellEdit` Stops editing and reverts the value in the active editor.\n- `resetDirtyCells` Clears all dirty cell indicators.\n- `dirtyCells` Gives a list of all currently dirty cells.\n- `exoprtToExcel(format: 'csv' | 'xlsx', filename: string, keepGridFormatting: boolean)` Export datagrid datasource to an excel file. This keeps grid formatting by default.\n\n## Filters\n\nData rows can be filter based on one or several criteria. Whole filter row can turned on/off by the api setting `filterable` and can be disabled by the api setting `filter-row-disabled`. The filter conditions can be applied thru the UI or programmatically. Each column can have its own filter type and turn on/off by columns setting.\n\n### Filter Columns Setting\n\nAll the filter settings can be passed thru columns data.\n\n|Setting|Type|Description|\n|---|---|---|\n|`filterType` | Function | Data grid built-in filter method, see the dedicated section below. |\n|`filterConditions` | Array | List of items to be use as operators in menu-button or options in dropdown. |\n|`filterFunction` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. |\n|`filterOptions` | Object | Setting for components are in use, for example: `label, placeholder, disabled`. |\n|`isChecked` | Function | User defined filter method, it must return a boolean. This method use along built-in `checkbox` only, when filter data value is not boolean type. |\n\n### Built-in Filter Methods\n\n|Method|Description|\n|---|---|\n|`text` | It filter as text comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`integer` | It filter as integer comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`decimal` | It filter as decimal comparison. Contains input and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`contents` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and auto generate list of items based on column data. |\n|`dropdown` | It filter as text comparison. Contains dropdown and must pass list of item by setting `filterConditions`. |\n|`checkbox` | It filter as boolean comparison. Contains menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`date` | It filter as date comparison. Contains date-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n|`time` | It filter as time comparison. Contains time-picker and menu-button with list of default operators. |\n\n### Custom Filter\n\nIf the built-in filters are not enough, creating a custom filter is an option. There are two parts you can create both parts custom or mix-match with built-in.\n\n1. `UI Only` In order to do custom UI part of filter, add as html markup thru a slot. It must use slot and column-id attributes for example: `<div slot=\"filter-n\" column-id=\"n\">...</div>` where n is the columnId same passed in the columns.\n1. `filterFunction` This is a user defined filter method which must return a boolean. It determines if a cell value should be considered as a valid filtered value.\n1. `disableClientFilter` This is an api setting to disable filter logic client side. It will set filter conditions and fire an event `filtered` which can listen for custom logic.\n\n### Filter Code Examples\n\nBasic text filters\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\"

rows programmatically\n\n```js\n// Filter rows\nconst conditions = [{ columnId: 'description', operator: 'contains', value: '5' }];\ndataGrid.applyFilter(conditions);\n\n// Reset all filters\ndataGrid.applyFilter([]);\n```\n\n### Filter Events\n\nThe following events are relevant to data-grid filters.\n\n- `filtered` Fires after a filter action occurs, clear or apply filter condition.\n- `filteroperatorchanged` Fires once a filter operator changed.\n- `filterrowopened` Fires after the filter row is opened by the user.\n- `filterrowclosed` Fires after the filter row is closed by the user.\n\n## Custom cell colors\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to customize the background color of cells.  This can be done with the `cssPart` column setting:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell'\n});\n```\n\nThe `cssPart` property is translated into a `part` attribute that is applied to every cell in the column.  In the event the color needs to be conditional based on the row index or other logic, a function can be used:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nAfter this is defined, accompanying CSS can be written to target the parts `custom-cell`, `custom-cell-1`, and `custom-cell-2` to change background color or other CSS properties of the cell:\n\n```css\nids-data-grid::part(cell) {\n  background-color: #ebf9f1;\n}\n\nids-data-grid::part(cell-selected) {\n  background-color: #c9dad0;\n}\n```\n\n### Changing selected cell colors\n\nAnother column setting, `cellSelectedCssPart` can be used alongside `cssPart` to customize the selected color of the row in a similar way.  When using `mixed` selection, this color is also applied to activated rows:\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  cssPart: 'custom-cell',\n  cellSelectedCssPart: 'custom-cell-selected'\n});\n```\n\nThis column setting can also be a function, just like `cssPart`:\n\n```js\ncolumns.push({\n  // ...\n  cssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-1' : 'custom-cell-2'),\n  cellSelectedCssPart: (row: number) => ((row % 2 === 0) ? 'custom-cell-selected-1' : 'custom-cell-selected-2')\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Tooltip Code Examples\n\nSet suppress tooltips to turn off.\n\n```html\n<ids-data-grid id=\"data-grid-1\" label=\"Books\" suppress-tooltips>\n</ids-data-grid>\n```\n\nSet custom tooltip strings.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: 'This is a product Id',\n  headerTooltip: 'This is the product Id header title',\n  headerIconTooltip: 'This is product Id header icon',\n  filterButtonTooltip: 'This is the product Id filterButton'\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip as callback.\n\n```js\nconst tooltipCallback = (args: any): string => {\n  const { type, columnIndex, rowIndex, text } = args;\n\n  if (type === 'header-title') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>Header Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return `Text: ${text}<br/>FilterButton Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n  }\n  return `Text: ${text}<br/>for Row: ${rowIndex}, Cell: ${columnIndex}`;\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltip: tooltipCallback\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip custom options.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipOptions: {\n

headerIconPlacement: 'top', headerIconX: 0, headerIconY: 10 };\n  } else if (type === 'filter-button') {\n    return { filterButtonPlacement: 'bottom', filterButtonX: 0, filterButtonY: 22 };\n  }\n  return { placement: 'top', x: 0, y: 10 };\n};\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipOptions: tooltipOptionsCallback\n});\n```\n\nSet tooltip custom css.\n\n```js\nconst columns = [];\ncolumns.push({\n  id: 'text',\n  name: 'Text',\n  field: 'description',\n  tooltipCssPart: 'custom-turquoise',\n  headerTooltipCssPart:

Filtered\n\n**Cells**\n- Hover (sometimes a cursor change)\n- Readonly\n- Focus\n- Checked/Not Checked (Checkboxes)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd>The initial tab enters the grid with focus on the first cell of the first row, often a header. A second tab moves out of the grid to the next tab stop on the page. Once focus is established in the grid, a TAB into or a Shift Tab into the grid will return to the cell which last had focus. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the next cell.\n- <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> Moves the reverse of tab. If in edit mode will finish editing and start editing the previous cell.\n- <kbd>Left</kbd> and <kbd>Right</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent column's cell. There is no wrap at the end or beginning of columns.\n- <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> Move focus to the adjacent row's cell. There is no wrap at the first or last row.\n- <kbd>Home</kbd> moves focus to the first cell of the current row\n- <kbd>End</kbd> moves focus to the last cell of the current row\n- <kbd>Page Up</kbd> moves focus to the first cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> moves focus to the last cell in the current column\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggles selection the activate row. If suppressRowDeselection is set it will be ignored on deselect. If the cell contains an expandable element then the row will toggle the expanded state. If the cell contains a checkbox editor, will toggle the checkbox state.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> toggles actionable mode. Pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key while in actionable mode moves focus to the next actionable cell. While in actionable mode you can do things like type + enter. This will move you down a row when you hit enter. If the cell has a control that uses down arrow (like the drop downs or lookups that are editable). Then the user needs to hit enter to enable the edit mode on that cell.\n- <kbd>Triple Click</kbd> Not a keyboard shortcut, but if you have text in a cell that is overflowed a triple click will select all the text even the part that is invisible.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Ctrl+A (PC) / Cmd+A (Mac)</kbd> If the grid is mixed or multi select this will select all rows.\n- <kbd>Enter</kbd> Activates edit mode on the cell if it is editable. There is also an \"auto edit detection\". If the user starts typing then edit mode will happen automatically without enter. If in edit mode already <kbd>Enter</kbd> will finish edit mode. If `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in next row.\n- <kbd>Shift + Enter</kbd> Same as enter but if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled then editing will start on the same column in previous row.\n- <kbd>F2</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter. But if `editNextOnEnterPress` is enabled, will stay in same cell. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n- <kbd>CMD/CTRL + Enter</kbd> Finish editing same as Enter.\n- <kbd>ESC</kbd> Revert to the previous value and cancel editing. `cancelEditMode` will fire.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- By default, data grid grows depending on the amount of contents within and will scroll if necessary under the header. It stops growing when it reaches the size of the parent container.\n- `autoFit` property or `auto-fit` attribute can be set manually to make the data grid size fill and be responsive to the size of the screen, regardless of the amount of contents.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Counts have all new markup and classes.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Data grid has all new markup and a custom element but some similarly named options\n- Still uses same columns and data set options. Some column options enhanced and changed.\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example: sorted, rendered\n- Some Api Functions have changed\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes or as plain properties for example: data, virtual-scroll\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-data-grid></ids-data-grid>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- `Drill Down` Formatter is now covered by `Button` formatter with `icon=\"drilldown\"`\n- `textOverflow` setting is now by default\n- `rowNavigation` setting has replaced `cellNavigation`. Cell navigation is the default behavior.\n- `stretchColumn` is now more flexible and can be achieved by setting a column width to `minmax(130px, 4fr)`. I.E. some min width and a `fr` unit equal to the remaining number of columns (or similar variations).\n- split columns are not supported anymore but could be done with a custom formatter if needed\n- `frozenColumns` setting is now set on each column by adding `frozen: 'left'` or `frozen: 'right'` to the column definition.\n- Some events are renamed see the events section for more details, also the signature of the events has changed.\n- Custom formatter functions can now be any type of function and have a different signature.\n- The `expanded` column option for tree was renamed to `rowExpanded`.\n- The `expandrow/collapserow` events are renamed to `rowexpanded/rowcollapsed`\n- The `beforeentereditmode/entereditmode/exiteditmode` event is renamed to `beforecelledit/celledit/endcelledit/cancelcelledit`\n- The `actionablemode` feature has been replaced with simply tabbing to the next editable field when in edit mode.\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n1.1.1 Non-text Content - All images, links and icons have text labels for screen readers when the formatters are used.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and links and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.\n- 2.1.1 Keyboard - Make all functionality available from a keyboard. The grid has keyboard shortcuts and is usable with a screen reader due to the addition of aria tags.\n- A datagrid in general including this one uses the following aria tags\n  - `aria-label` labels the enter table on the main table\n  - `aria-rowcount` lists the visible row count on the main table\n  - `aria-colindex` the index of each column on the column elements\n  - `aria-rwindex` the index of each row on the row elements\n  - `aria-setsize` for tree grid lists the number of elements in each level (group)\n  - `aria-level` the level of indentation\n  - `aria-posinset` the depth into each set\n  - `aria-expanded` on the row it indicates if the row is expanded (for tree and expandable row)\n  - `aria-sort` indicates the sort direction on the sortable columns\n  - `aria-checked` indicates if the element is checked on checkbox columns and headers\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles and labels should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Code Separation (For Developers)\n\nThe code is divided into several files. Here is a description of where everything is.\n\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.ts` creates a non-shadow root `ids-data-grid-cell`, and handles its own selection, and activation.\n- `ids-data-grid-cell.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-cell` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-contextmenu.ts` contains code in the form of export functions, that adds ability to get right click menus on headers and cells\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.scss` contains all css related to the filter row and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-filter.ts` contains code to implement the filtering functionality and its ui (some functions are in ids-data-source)\n- `ids-data-grid-formatters.ts` contains all formatter functions and some supporting code like data extraction\n- `ids-data-grid-header.ts` contains most header functionality, the header template, and code related to header actions like sort, reorder and selection.\n- `ids-data-grid-header.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-header` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-row.ts` contains most row functionality, the row template, and code related to row actions like expand, collapse, select, activate\n- `ids-data-grid-row.scss` contains all css related to `.ids-data-grid-row` and its children\n- `ids-data-grid-tooltip-mixin.js` contains a tooltip mixin that adds tooltip functionality to cells and headers, its different from `ids-tooltip-mixin` (more specific)\n- `ids-data-grid.js` contains all main data grid code, the api and settings and the main generator loop for the data grid\n"

        "value": "# Ids Message\n\nThe IdsMessage Component provides a quick interface for displaying an application message to the user in [Modal]('../ids-modal/README.md'), along with providing quick actions related to the message.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Display application information that requires a user's attention\n- Convey a specific status to the user\n- Provide actions that the user can take to address the information\n\n## Terminology\n\n**Status** Indicates whether the message is normal (default), error, alert, success, or informative\n\n## Attributes and Properties\n\n- `status` sets/removes the Status type\n- `message` sets the contents of the message\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA basic, barebones message might look like this:\n\n```html\n<ids-message id=\"my-message\">\n    <p>This is my message</p>\n</ids-message>\n```\n\nMessages can have titles and buttons (just the same as [Modals](../ids-modal/README.md)), as well as Statuses.  Statuses and Titles are appended with an attribute on the Message, while Buttons are added by slot.\n\n```html\n<ids-message id=\"my-message\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">My Message Title</ids-text>\n    <p>This is my message</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" appearance=\"secondary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" appearance=\"primary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-message>\n```\n\nYou can manipulate the Message by using its Javascript API\n\n```js\nconst messageEl = document.querySelector('#my-message');\nmessageEl.messageTitle = 'Different Title';\nmessageEl.message = 'Alternate Message';\nmessageEl.status = 'success';\n```\n\nMessages extend [Modals](../ids-modal/README.md), so it's possible to configure them in similar fashion.  You can control Messages manually with the same API:\n\n```js\n// Manually show a Message Component\nconst messageEl = document.querySelector('#my-message');\nmessageEl.show();\n```\n\nYou can also use the Modal's `target` property to activate a Message component by clicking an associated target element, like a button for example:\n\n```html\n<ids-message id=\"my-message\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">My Message Title</ids-text>\n    <p>This is my message</p>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" appearance=\"secondary\">OK</ids-modal-button>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" appearance=\"primary\" cancel>Cancel</ids-modal-button>\n</ids-message>\n\n<ids-button id=\"trigger-button\" appearance=\"secondary\">\n    <span>Show Message</span>\n    <ids-icon icon=\"launch\"></ids-icon>\n</ids-button>\n```\n\n```js\n// Show a message component when clicking a trigger button\nconst messageEl = document.querySelector('#my-message');\nconst btnEl = document.querySelector('#trigger-button');\nmessageEl.target = btnEl;\n\nbtnEl.click();\n```\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Very similar and compatible with newer versions of 3.X\n- dialogType option deprecated. Instead use either modal or message component\n- shortMessage option now called message because there is only one option buttons works the same\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The message component has been changed to a web component and renamed to `ids-message`.\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-message></ids-message>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- Close X is deprecated as it is redundant with the modal buttons\n- Allowed tags is not needed as you can put your own markup in the light DOM now\n- The Message component now extends the Modal component, containing the same properties and methods.\n- Modal Buttons, Title, Status, and Message can be changed via API\n"

Best practice is to use an IdsText element inside the legend possibly with a type like h2.\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <ids-fieldset>\n    <legend><ids-text font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\">Company Information</ids-text></legend>\n    <ids-input type=\"text\" label=\"Company Name\" id=\"company-name\"></ids-input>\n    <ids-input type=\"text\" label=\"Company Type\" id=\"type\"></ids-input>\n    <ids-input type=\"text\" label=\"Company Address\" id=\"company-address\"></ids-input>\n    <ids-checkbox label=\"Checked\" checked=\"true\"></ids-checkbox>\n    <ids-button appearance=\"primary\">Submit</ids-button>\n  </ids-fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `fieldset` allows you to further style the fieldset HTML element in the slot\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\nField sets have a default responsive behavior to move from two columns to one at our mobile breakpoints. The behavior is not limited to this, however, it is important to keep in mind the complexity that a multitude of content columns can bring to an application experience.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n- Removed the expand/collapse button, Changed class inforFieldSetLabel and inforFieldSet\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The fieldset component has been changed to a web component and renamed to `<ids-fieldset>`.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-fieldset>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The uses flexible slots for content\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nThe fieldset will flip in in Right To Left languages.\n"

There are currently 4 color variants available: `full-time`, `part-time`, `contractor` and `open-position`.\n\n```html\n<ids-hierarchy-item id=\"item-1\" color-variant=\"full-time\">\n    <img src=\"..../assets/images/images/headshot-1.jpg\" alt=\"item-1\" slot=\"avatar\" />\n    <ids-text slot=\"heading\">Tony Cleveland</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"subheading\">Director</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"micro\">FT</ids-text>\n</ids-hierarchy-item>\n\n<ids-hierarchy-item id=\"item-2\" color-variant=\"part-time\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"heading\">Julie Dawes</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"subheading\">Records Clerk</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"micro\">PT</ids-text>\n</ids-hierarchy-item>\n\n<ids-hierarchy-item id=\"item-5\" color-variant=\"contractor\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"heading\">Tony Cleveland</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"subheading\">Director</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"micro\">C</ids-text>\n</ids-hierarchy-item>\n\n<ids-hierarchy-item id=\"item-4\" color-variant=\"open-position\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"heading\">Julie Dawes</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"subheading\">Records Clerk</ids-text>\n    <ids-text slot=\"micro\">OP</ids-text>\n</ids-hierarchy-item>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- **root-item**: This is an attribute that can be added the top level `ids-hierarchy-item`. This is added to adjust the styling of the root item.\n- **Expanded**: The state where the leaf's children are visible. Sometimes it serves as the default state, this state can also be remembered by the application.\n- **Selected**: The state where the leaf appears selected or focused\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- **Enter or Space**: When focus is on an `icon-btn`, this keystroke toggles the expansion of the corresponding leaf. If collapsed, the leaf is expanded, and its aria-expanded state is set to true. If expanded, the leaf is collapsed and its aria-expanded state is set to false.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The Hierarchy component has been changed to a web component and use with `ids-hierarchy`, `ids-hierarchy-item` and `ids-hierarchy-legend`.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-hidden>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- The multi level hierarchy has been removed (as is multi root)\n- The paging hierarchy has been discontinued\n"

The `cols` attribute sets the number of columns in the grid layout by default. The `cols-lg` attribute sets the number of columns in the grid layout at the lg breakpoint size (large devices/screen sizes). The `cols-xl` attribute sets the number of columns in the grid layout at the xl breakpoint size (extra-large devices/screen sizes).\n\nFinally, the `cols-xxl` attribute sets the number of columns in the grid layout at the xxl breakpoint size (extra-extra-large devices/screen sizes). Overall, this code is defining a grid layout that will display two columns by default and adjust the number of columns displayed at different breakpoint sizes for different device types.\n\n---\n\n```html\n<ids-layout-grid-cell col-span=\"2\" col-span-lg=\"4\">\n```\n\nThis `<ids-layout-grid-cell>` element is used to define a cell within a grid layout. It has two attributes (`col-span` and `col-span-lg`) that define the number of columns a cell should span at different breakpoint sizes. The `col-span` attribute sets the number of columns that the cell should span by default. The `col-span-lg` attribute sets the number of columns that the cell should span at the lg breakpoint size (large devices) and its value is set to 4. Overall, this code is defining a cell within a grid layout that will span two columns by default and adjust the number of columns it spans at the lg breakpoint size.\n\n---\n\n```html\n<ids-layout-grid\n    auto-fit\n    min-col-width=\"100px\"\n    max-col-width=\"1fr\"\n>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n</ids-layout-grid>\n```\n\nFor AutoFit layout the grid cells in this example have a min/max value of 100px and 1fr respectively. The cells will take up as much space as is available until they reach the threshold of the MinColWidth, then they will automatically shift until they reach that threshold again. This removes the need for media queries in many cases.\n\n---\n\n```html\n<ids-layout-grid cols=\"4\">\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell col-span=\"3\" fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell row-span=\"2\" fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n</ids-layout-grid>\n```\n\nAn Ids Layout Grid with a custom number of columns or rows. The example below shows a 4 column grid where the first cell spans 3 columns and the 3rd cell spans 2 rows.\n\n---\n\nExamples of grid with responsive col-spans\n\n```html\n<ids-layout-grid\n    cols=\"12\"\n>\n  <ids-layout-grid-cell col-span=\"12\" col-span-sm=\"6\" fill>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"12\">2 Cols</ids-text>\n  </ids-layout-grid-cell>\n  <ids-layout-grid-cell col-span=\"12\" col-span-sm=\"6\" col-span-md=\"4\" fill>\n    <ids-text font-size=\"12\">2 Cols</ids-text>\n  </ids-layout-grid-cell>\n</ids-layout-grid>\n```\n\n--\n\nNested Grid. An IdsLayoutGrid component can be nested inside an IdsLayoutGridCell.\n\n```html\n<ids-layout-grid cols=\"4\">\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell col-span=\"3\" fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell row-span=\"2\" fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill>\n      <ids-layout-grid auto>\n        <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n        <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n        <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n      </ids-layout-grid>\n   </ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n   <ids-layout-grid-cell fill></ids-layout-grid-cell>\n</ids-layout-grid>\n```\n\nStandalone CSS Example\n\n```html\n<div class=\"ids-layout-grid ids-layout-grid-cols-3\">\n  <div class=\"ids-layout-grid-cell ids-layout-grid-col-span-2 fill\"><ids-text font-size=\"12\">A</ids-text></div>\n  <div class=\"ids-layout-grid-cell fill\"><ids-text font-size=\"12\">B</ids-text></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n--\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nA layout grid is not on its own keyboard focusable and has no keyboard interaction.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- A Layout Grid set to auto-fit or auto-fill will flow automatically with the screen size.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- New concept in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The Layout grid replaces the former grid entirely. Apply the new markup.\n- Using a 8pt style grid https://builttoadapt.io/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-d2573cde8632\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-layout-grid></ids-layout-grid>` (see examples above)\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nThe entire grid will flip direction in Right-To-Left languages.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Swappable\n\n## Description\nIdsSwappable is an abstract component that provides functionality for drag and drop between items or lists. It consists of two components `ids-swappable` which is a container for and number of `ids-swappable-item`. The `ids-swappable-item` makes use of s single `slot` where the user can use virtually any component they would like, most commonly `ids-text` or `ids-card`.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nIdsSwappable is used to create the [IdsSwaplist](../ids-swaplist/README.md), which is used to move objects between 2 or more lists, but is not limited to this use case. It can also be used to create standalone sortable/swappable element collections.\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nBasic Usage:\n\n```html\n<ids-swappable>\n    <ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\" overflow=\"ellipsis\" tooltip=\"true\">Item One</ids-text>\n    </ids-swappable-item>\n    <ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\" overflow=\"ellipsis\" tooltip=\"true\">Item Two</ids-text>=\n    </ids-swappable-item>\n    <ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-text font-size=\"20\" type=\"h2\" overflow=\"ellipsis\" tooltip=\"true\">Item Three</ids-text>\n    </ids-swappable-item>\n</ids-swappable>\n```\n\nIdsSwaplist example:\n\n```html\n<ids-swaplist id=\"swaplist-1\" count=\"2\"></ids-swaplist>\n```\n\n```js\nconst swappable = document.querySelector('#swaplist-1').container.querySelectorAll('ids-swappable');\n\ndata.forEach((d) => {\n    swappable.innerHTML += `\n    <ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-text>${d.city}</ids-text>\n    </ids-swappable-item>\n    `;\n});\n```\n\n### Mix with other components\n\nSome components support composition with IdsSwappable, such as [IdsTabs](../ids-tabs/README.md).  Since Tabs have their own process for handling selection, using `dragMode=\"always\"` ensures tabs can be moved around regardless of selection:\n\n```html\n<ids-tabs>\n    <ids-swappable dropzone=\"move\">\n        <ids-swappable-item drag-mode=\"always\">\n            <ids-tab value=\"contracts\">Contracts</ids-tab>\n        </ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-swappable-item drag-mode=\"always\">\n            <ids-tab value=\"opportunities\">Opportunities</ids-tab>\n        </ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-swappable-item drag-mode=\"always\">\n            <ids-tab value=\"attachments\" disabled>Attachments</ids-tab>\n        </ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-swappable-item drag-mode=\"always\">\n            <ids-tab value=\"notes\">Notes</ids-tab>\n        </ids-swappable-item>\n    </ids-swappable>\n</ids-tabs>\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n### ids-swappable\n**selectedItems** Sets the multi-select attribute. Defaults to false.\n\n### ids-swappable-item\n**drag-mode** Defines how/when dragging can occur.  By default (`select`), swappable items must first be selected in order to be dragged.  Setting to `always` makes dragging possible at all times.\n**selected** Sets the selected attribute. Items need to be selected before that can be dragged.\n**originalText** Sets the originalText attribute. This happens when the component is connected and is used to revert the text after item is dropped.\n**tabbable** Sets if the item is tabbable. Defaults to true.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Sortable behavior is part of the Arrange component\n- Arrange was added in v4.2.1\n- Invoke the Arrange component on an element with `$('#my-element').arrange();`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Sortable behavior is now enabled by wrapping elements on a page with `<ids-swappable></ids-swappable>` and `<ids-swappable-item></ids-swappable-item>`\n"

The list view container can feature checkboxes, search bar, hyperlinks, and other elements.\n- Allows users to assign/remove objects. Displays when one or more rows are selected.\n- Can alert users of updates on objects.\n- Lists may be single, multiple or mixed selected\n- Lists can be filter data by using the search field\n- You can have a fixed list toolbar on top, which may contain a title and filtering/search options\n- You can have a contextual toolbar for selected items\n- Pagination is supported\n\n## Terminology\n\n- Card: UI design pattern that groups related information that resembles a card\n- Group Action: A special toolbar inside the card content area that can be used to act on the content.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nThis example shows using a list view with an html template element bound to a dataset.

the list view search-field container element\n- `searchfield-field-container` allows you to further style the list view search-field field container element\n- `searchfield-input` allows you to further style the list view search-field input element\n- `searchfield-popup` allows you to further style the list view search-field popup element\n\n## Events\n\n- `beforeselected` Fires before selected an item, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `selected` Fires after selected an item\n- `beforedeselected` Fires before deselected an item, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `deselected` Fires after deselected an item\n- `beforeitemactivated` Fires before activated an item, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `itemactivated` Fires after activated an

callback\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Hover\n- Selected\n- Focus\n- Disabled\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> When a list is tabbed to, select the first item if nothing else is already selected. A second tab will take the user out of the widget to the next tab stop on the page.\n- <kbd>Up/down arrow</kbd> navigate up and down the list.\n- <kbd>Shift+F10</kbd> If the current item has an associated context menu, then this key combination will launch that menu.\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> toggles <a href=\"http://access.aol.com/dhtml-style-guide-working-group/#checkbox\" target=\"_blank\">checkboxes</a> in the case of multi select or a list item in case of normal select\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The list is 100% of the parent container in height and width so can be used in a widget object or responsive grid object.\n- The list body will expand vertically and horizontally to fill it the size of its parent container.\n- When used in homepages, special rules apply with sizes.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Single select roughly replaces the inforListBox component.\n- Multi select is a new feature, however it replaces the listbox with checkboxes construct.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The List View component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-list-view.\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-list-view></ids-list-view>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example\n- The template is now a template element that uses simple string substitution\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles (in some browsers)\n- Alternate row colors is deprecated\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.1.1 Non-text Content - All images, links and icons have text labels for screen readers when the formatters are used.\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  All statuses and objects must pass.\n- 2.1.1 Keyboard - Make all functionality available from a keyboard. The grid has keyboard shortcuts and is usable with a screen reader due to the addition of aria tags.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nTitles should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German) and in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n"

Single selection and multi selection can be possible in the modal dialog by setting the data grid settings.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Best used when users need more contextual information around selecting options from the grid columns.\n- Use when you want users to contribute data to your website and let them organize their content themselves.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Grid/Data Grid**: Refers to a data grid when in a lookup as apposed to a responsive grid.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal lookup used as a web component. To distinguish between single and multi-select situations, use a checkbox column in multi-select and consider a radio select for single select. The set the appropriate settings in the data grid.\n\n```html\n<ids-lookup id=\"lookup-1\" label=\"Normal Lookup\"></ids-lookup>\n```\n\nIf necessary you can provide your own custom modal to the lookup. When doing this you control the modal contents and events entirely. The lookup will just open it for you.\n\n```html\n<ids-lookup id=\"custom-lookup\" label=\"Custom Lookup\">\n    <ids-modal slot=\"lookup-modal\" id=\"custom-lookup-modal\" aria-labelledby=\"custom-lookup-modal-title\">\n    <ids-text slot=\"title\" font-size=\"24\" type=\"h2\" id=\"lookup-modal-title\">Custom Lookup Modal</ids-text>\n    <ids-modal-button slot=\"buttons\" id=\"modal-close-btn\" appearance=\"primary\">\n        <span>Apply</span>\n    </ids-modal-button>\n    </ids-modal>\n</ids-lookup>\n```\n\nTo set all of the datagrid setting, pass the settings to the gridSettings property.\n\n```js\nlookup.dataGridSettings = {\n  rowSelection: 'multiple',\n  pageSize: 5,\n  pageNumber: 1,\n  pagination: 'client-side'\n};\nlookup.data = data;\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `autocomplete` {boolean} Set the lookup to autocomplete, it will use the data for autocomplete / typeahead selection\n- `disabled` {boolean} Set the lookup to disabled state.\n- `readonly` {boolean} Set the lookup to readonly state.\n- `field` {string} Set the field to use in the data set when selecting.\n- `label` {string} Set the label on the input.\n- `tabbable` {boolean} Turns on the functionality allow the trigger to be tabbable. For accessibility reasons this should be on in most cases and this is the default.\n- `gridSettings` {object} An object containing name/value pairs for all the settings you want to pass to the data grid in the modal\n- `columns` {Array<object>} Set the data array of the data grid. This can be a JSON Array.\n- `data` {Array<object>} Set the columns array of the data grid. See column settings.\n- `validate` {'required' | string} Sets the validation routine to use\n- `validationEvents` {'blur' | string} Sets the validation events to use\n- `value` {string} Sets the field value, use commas to delimit multiple values.\n- `title` {string} Sets the title on the lookup.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `checkbox` allows you to further style the checkbox input element\n- `trigger-field` allows you to further style the trigger container\n- `input`  allows you to further style the input element\n- `trigger-button` allows you to further style the trigger button\n- `icon` allows you to further style the icon in the trigger button\n- `modal`  allows you to further style the modal dialog container\n- `data-grid` allows you to further style the data grid element\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Default: The normal, unaltered state for lookups.\n- Hover: The state where a user moves over the lookup field with their cursor.\n- Focus: Indicates that the user has tabbed through and highlighted the lookup.\n- Disabled When the lookup is unable to be changed due to its dependence on other factors or partial irrelevance. Since these states can sometimes lead to confusion, it's useful to pair this state with a Tooltip explanation as to why it's disabled.\n- Readonly A lookup state where the selection is only, ever for viewing. While the information cannot be changed, users can copy and view the data. In general a label and value can also be used for read only states as well.\n- Error: The state where the user has interacted with the field and received an error. The lookup field is able to explain what caused the error below.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: Moves focus into the field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: Opens the dialog if the input is enabled\n- <kbd>Esc</kbd>: Cancels and closes the open dialog\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: Tab and Shift Tab when the dialog is open, tab will move around the items, for example, from the search to the data grid\n- <kbd>Down/Up Arrow</kbd>: When focus is on the grid in the dialog this moves the focus up and down on the rows\n- <kbd>Space</kbd>: Toggle selection on the current row if multiselect. If single select, the row is selected and inserted if autoApply is enabled.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default size is 300px wide but there are a number of widths in mobile mode it will go to 100%\n- The dialog stretches to 100% - 16px at smaller breakpoints\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Lookup had all new markup and classes for web components.\n- inforLookup class changed to lookup\n- Initialization options and API is different\n- Uses events rather than callbacks\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- It has all new markup and classes for web components.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-lookup></ids-lookup>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- Greatly simplified the API\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- There should be a label on all lookups to give an indication what the field is containing.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLabels should be localized in the current language. The close and link icons will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

When running in mingle shell, you should detect and do not show the mast head.\n\nThe masthead can be found in tenant environments that are opted in to the CloudSuite. It provides navigation to other applications, homepages, and bookmarks within the environment. The masthead is a visual representation of InforOS, which serves as a database for all information and actions made by users within different applications within the suite.\n\nIn some cases, the masthead may be implemented in a context outside of the CloudSuite. This should only be done when it is necessary to surface global actions that affect more than one page within an application and do not fit into the context of a page header.\n\nActions and links found in the masthead are configurable by the tenant admin. The masthead will almost always have:\n\nThe application tray: allows users to navigate to other applications within a tenants suite\n- Search: pulls results from the current application and around the cloud suite\n- Bookmarks: allows users to save specific pages within applications and access them from anywhere within the cloud suite\n- User settings: central place for end users to view/edit their personal information and any global preferences\n\nSome optional features in the masthead:\n- Company logo/home icon: navigates the user to the default or preferred home page\n- Coleman\n- Inbox\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- A masthead can provide a prominent application level bar to other applications, homepages, and bookmarks within a Web Application.\n- A masthead can be utilized when it is necessary to surface global actions that affect more than one page within a Web Application.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Masthead**: A custom HTML element that serves as the primary header bar on a page.\n- **Icon**: Icon is the company-logo in the masthead.\n- **Title**: Title is text that appears next to the logo.\n- **Slots**: Slots are sections in the masthead that allow users to customize where buttons appear in the masthead. There are 4 slots: `start`, `center`, `end`, `more`.\n\n## Feature (With the Code Examples)\n\nAn masthead is created by using the `ids-masthead` tag. It has a `icon` property to set the desired logo/icon for the masthead.  It also has a `title` property to set the text that appears next to the logo/icon.\n\nMasthead with `icon` and `title` attributes:\n\n```html\n<ids-masthead icon=\"logo\" title=\"Infor Application\"></ids-masthead>\n```\n\nMasthead with `nav` elements as slots:\n\n```html\n<ids-masthead icon=\"logo\" title=\"Infor Application\">\n  <section slot=\"start\">\n    <ids-button icon=\"grid\"></ids-button>\n    <ids-button icon=\"star-outline\"></ids-button>\n  </section>\n  <section slot=\"center\">\n    <ids-button icon=\"info\"></ids-button>\n  </section>\n  <section slot=\"end\">\n    <ids-button icon=\"user\"></ids-button>\n    <ids-button icon=\"bookmark-outline\"></ids-button>\n  </section>\n</ids-masthead>\n```\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsMasthead\n  - IdsHeader\n- Mixins\n  - IdsEventsMixin\n  - IdsKeyboardMixin\n\n## Settings\n\n- `icon` {string} Sets the masthead's icon attribute\n- `title` {string} Sets the masthead's title attribute\n- `slots` {readonly} An object containing the masthead's slots/sections for start|center|end|more\n- `breakpoints` {readonly}  object containing (window.matchMedia) breakpoints for mobile|tablet|desktop\n- `isMobile` {readonly} Returns true if the mobile breakpoint is active\n- `isTablet` {readonly} Returns true if the tablet breakpoint is active\n- `isDesktop` {readonly} Returns true if the desktop breakpoint is active\n\n## Events\n\n- `tab` {KeyboardEvent} Pressing the tab keyboard button will traverse all buttons in the masthead.\n\n## Methods\n\n- `renderBreakpoint()` Rearranges user's slots in masthead according to desktop, tablet and mobile viewports.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- None\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Mobile, tablet and desktop viewports/breakpoints\n\n## Accessibility\n\n- Use the `role=\"banner\"` Landmark role\n- Should use html5 section or nav type\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nA masthead's action buttons should function as a toolbar, see [toolbar](../ids-toolbar/README.md) page for guidelines.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\nA masthead will resize horizontally to mobile, tablet and desktop breakpoints. At the tablet and mobile breakpoints, buttons are moved into the \"More\" popup-menu.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Masthead replaces the inforTopBanner CSS. The markup and CSS Is entirely different to support new look and behavior.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- The masthead component has been changed to a web component and renamed to ids-masthead.\n- If using properties/settings these are now attributes.\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-masthead></ids-masthead>`\n- If using events events are now plain JS events for example (i.e. button click events)\n- The template is now a template element that uses simple string substitution\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles (in some browsers)\n- Design has changed\n"

A donut chart is almost identical to a pie chart, but the center is cut out (hence the name `donut`). Donut charts are also used to show proportions of categories that make up the whole, but the center can also be used to display a data label.\n\nYou can control the size of the pie/donut chart by setting the size of the parent element the pie chart lives in.

This data is also shown as a percentage in the legend.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Showcasing part-to-whole relationships.\n- Compare any type of content or data that can be broken down into comparative categories Revenue, demographics, market shares, survey results\n- Display different data points that total 100%\n\n## Usage Considerations\n\n- You don’t want to display more than six categories of data or the pie chart can be difficult to read and compare the relative size of slices.\n- If you have a lot of smaller slices this can be difficult to read.\n- Hover tooltips should only be used to reveal additional non-critical information.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Slice**: The pieces of the pie in a pie style chart represented by an individual data point\n- **Arcs**: The lengths of the slices in a donut style chart represented by an individual data point\n- **Donut**: The center is cut out on a pie chart too look like a donut\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nAn pie chart is defined with the custom element. By default it will size to the parent element but a width and height can also be set.\n\n```html\n\n```html\n<ids-pie-chart title=\"A pie chart showing component usage\" id=\"index-example\" suppress-tooltips=\"true\"></ids-pie-chart>\n```\n\nDatasets can be added to the pie chart by passing in an array of objects. Each object must have a `data` and object with `name` and `values` to form the data points. Other information like the `color`, `tooltip` or accessible `pattern` can be provided.\n\n```js\nconst data = [{\n   \"data\": [{\n     \"name\": \"Item A\",\n     \"tooltip\": \"<b>Item A</b> ${percent}%\",\n     \"value\": 10.1,\n     \"pattern\": \"mesh\"\n   },{\n     \"name\": \"Item B\",\n     \"tooltip\": \"<b>Item B</b> ${value}\",\n     \"value\": 12.2,\n     \"pattern\": \"mixed\"\n   }, {\n     \"name\": \"Item C\",\n     \"tooltip\": \"<b>Item C</b> ${value}\",\n     \"value\": 14.35,\n     \"pattern\": \"lines\"\n   }];\n\ndocument.querySelector('ids-pie-chart').data = lineData;\n```\n\nA chart can also be a `donut`. If used provided or `donut-text` for the center. Be consice since there isnt a lot of room.\n\n## Class Hierarchy\n\n- IdsPieChart\n  - IdsElement\n- Mixins\n  IdsChartSelectionMixin\n  IdsChartLegendMixin\n  IdsLocaleMixin\n  IdsEventsMixin\n\n## Data Settings\n\nThe following data attributes can be used on the data passed to a chart. If using typescript the type is `IdsPieChartData`.\n\n- `data` {object} A data group with one or more `name` and `value` pairs.\n- `name` {string} The name for the legend text and tooltip representing the slice.\n- `value` {number} The value of the slice, calculated to a whole of 100% with the other data points.\n- `color` {string} The color of this axis group. This can be either a hex value for example `#FF0000` or a color name like `red` or an ids variable like `var(--ids-color-azure-20)`.\n- `tooltip` {string} The custom tooltip string (as static text). See the tooltip section for more information.\n- `pattern` {string} The name of the pattern to show instead of a solid color. See the pattern section for more information.\n- `patternColor` {string} The color to show for the pattern. This can be either a hex value for example `#FF0000` or a color name like `red` or an ids variable like `var(--ids-color-azure-20)`.\n\n## Settings\n\n- `legendPlacement` {string} By default the legend will be placed to the right of the chart but it can also be set to `bottom` or `top` or `left`.\n- `animated` {boolean} Disable the animation of the chart by setting this to false.\n- `data` {Array} The data points to use as described previously\n- `donut` {boolean} Set to true to make a donut chart.\n- `donutText` {string} The text to showin the middle of the chart. Be consice since there isnt a lot of room.\n- `height` {number} To set the height of the chart to a specific value in pixels.\n- `width` {number} To set the width of the chart to a specific value in pixels.\n- `title` {string} The topic of the chart. This will be used only for accessibility / screen readers and should always be set.\n- `suppress-tooltips` {boolean} Disable the tooltips (they are currently experimental).\n- `legendFormatter` {Function} A function to format the legend text for each data point.\n- `selectable` {boolean} Sets the selection mode.\n\nHere is an example of a pie chart with a legendFormatter.\n\n```js\nchart.legendFormatter = (slice, data) => {\n  return `${slice.name}: ${slice.value}`;\n}\n```\n\n## Patterns\n\nThe pie/donut chart includes patterns that can be used to assist color blind users. To use a pattern specify it on the `pattern` attribute it in the data. You can also set a `patternColor` otherwise it will use the default color for that item in the series.\n\n```js\nconst data: [{\n  \"name\": \"Item C\",\n  \"tooltip\": \"<b>Item C</b> ${value}\",\n  \"value\": 14.35,\n  \"pattern\": \"lines\"\n}, {\n  \"name\": \"Item D\",\n  \"tooltip\": \"<b>Item D</b> ${value}\",\n  \"value\": 15.6,\n  \"pattern\": \"pipes\"\n}];\n```\n\nThe following patterns are supported:\n\n```sh\narrows\nboxes\ncheckers\npatches\ncircles\nexes\ndiamonds\ndots\nstars\nmixed\nsquares\nhex\nbig-hex\nintersect\nlines\nbars\npipes\nmesh\npluses\nwaves\nbig-waves\n```\n\nHowever some look better than others when zoomed. So suggest:\n\n```sh\nmesh\ncircles\nboxes\ndots\nmixed\nlines\npipes\n```\n\n## Tooltip Customizations\n\nYou can customize the tooltip by changing some of the API settings. For just a static tooltip you can use the `tooltip` setting in the data at the same place as the `name` property.\n\nIf you need to change which items get tooltips you can override `tooltipElements` getter.\n\n```js\ntooltipElements() {\n  return this.container.querySelectorAll('circle'); // return the ones that get events\n}\n\nIf you need to change the tooltip contents you can override the `tooltipTemplate` function.\n\n```js\ntooltipTemplate() {\n  return '<b>${label}</b> ${value}';\n}\n```\n\nOr you can modify the tooltip in the slot.\n\n## Events\n\n- `rendered` Fires each time the chart is rendered or rerendered (on resize).\n- `beforeselected` Fires before selected, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `selected` Fires after selected.\n- `beforedeselected` Fires before deselected, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `deselected` Fires after deselected.\n\n## Methods\n\n- `rerender` Re render and reanimate the chart.\n- `tooltipData` Override the data for the tooltip.\n- `tooltipTemplate` Override the tooltip markup\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` the outer container div element\n- `chart` the svg outer element\n- `circles` each circle element in the chart\n\n## Animation\n\nThe slices animate clockwise with a cubic bezier curve at 600ms.\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- selected (future)\n- disabled (future)\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe legend items are focusable and can be navigated with the tabs keys.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The area chart will fill the size of its parent container and readjust when the window is resized to the parent using css/svg viewbox\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- The pie chart was added after version 3.6 so new in 4.x\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n- Pie component has changed to a custom element `<ids-pie-chart></ids-pie-chart>`\n- Donut component has been combined with a setting `<ids-pie-chart donut=\"true\" donut-text=\"Some Test\"></ids-pie-chart>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.\n- Markup is to treat the pie slices as a list `role=\"list\"`. The pie slices are `role=\"listitem\"`. The tab index is not visible to the user as it is not needed and can be navigated with a screen reader.\n- Using voice over the sequence is to\n  - Navigate to the parent element above it  or parent page\n  - Hold <kbd>caps lock + left/right arrow</kbd>\n  - You will hear the title , followed by number of items and then each list item\n  - Proceed to use <kbd>caps lock + left/right arrow</kbd> will move through the list items announcing the values\n- The contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing higher contrast colors. Or you can add a pattern to the color with the `pattern` attribute.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nChart labels should be localized in the current language. The chart will flip in RTL mode. Note that in RTL languages clockwise is the same so the chart slices / arcs are not rotated.  For some color blind users the svg patterns can be used.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Progress Chart Component\n\n## Description\n\nSimilar to the [Progress Bar](../ids-progress-bar/README.md) web component, this component is more ideal for creating a standard bar chart visual. It is useful for showing the progress completed or time remaining for a task/goal, since it has customizable labels and colors. It is a simple web component where the amount of progress and total progress can be set with the `progress` and `total` setting/attribute, respectively. Labels can be set with `label`, `label-progress`, `label-total` and can include icons which need to be inserted as a child of the component in the HTML.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Showing progress or time remaining for a task/goal\n\n## Terminology\n\n- Progress Chart: A standard basic progress element which has progress, total progress, and 3 customizable labels\n- Label: A label web component element to label the title, amount of progress, and amount of total progress\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nThe examples below can be viewed at [http://localhost:4300/ids-progress-chart/readme-examples](http://localhost:4300/ids-progress-chart/readme-examples)\n\n### A standard basic progress chart\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Basic\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\nThe default total is 100, so even if you leave that field blank, it will render as 50% progress. There is also a default color for the progress bar.\n\n### Adding colors\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"#A876EB\" color=\"#A876EB\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\nWith the use of IDS tokens, the above is visually identical to the following:\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Amethyst-40\" color=\"amethyst-40\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n### Using Decimals\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Decimals\" progress=\"0.7\" total=\"1\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n### Adding labels\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Decimals with labels\" label-progress=\"0.7\" progress=\"0.7\" label-total=\"1\" total=\"1\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Sprint progress\" label-progress=\"1 week\" progress=\"1\" label-total=\"2 wks\" total=\"2\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n### Indicating caution, warning, or error\n\nThere are colors associated with the certain statuses\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Error\" color=\"error\" progress=\"50\" label-progress=\"50%\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Warning\" color=\"warning\" progress=\"50\" label-progress=\"50%\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Caution\" color=\"caution\" progress=\"50\" label-progress=\"50%\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\nThese are the few scenarios where it will color the progress label as well\n\n### Adding icons\n\nYou can include icons in the label heading\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart icon=\"error\" label=\"Error with icon\" color=\"error\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n### Adjust the size\n\nThere are 2 sizes, `small` and `normal`\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"Compact\" size=\"small\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\nIcons adjust accordingly to the size of the chart\n\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart icon=\"alert\" label=\"Compact w/ icon\" size=\"small\" progress=\"50\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes)\n\n- `progress` { string | number } set the progress value attribute\n- `total` { string | number } set the total progress value attribute\n- `color` { string } set the color of the progress bar\n- `size` { 'small' | 'normal' } set the size of the progress bar\n- `label` { string } set the title label\n- `icon` { string } set the icon type\n- `label-progress` { string } set the progress value label\n- `label-total` { string } set the total progress value label\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- By default, the width stretches to 100% of the parent container\n- The minimum width is 66px\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n*Completion Chart:*\n- The Completion Chart component was added in v4.4.0\n- Completion Chart is invoked with `$('#my-element').chart({ type: 'completion-target' });`\n\n*Targeted Achievement Chart:*\n- The Targeted Achievement Chart component is new in 4.4.0\n- Targeted Achievement Chart is invoked with `$('#my-element').chart({ type: 'targeted-achievement' });`\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Features from both Targeted Achievement Charts and Completion Charts have been merged into a new web component called IdsProgressChart\n- IdsProgressChart is a custom element `<ids-progress-chart></ids-progress-chart>`\n\n### Converting from 4.x\n\nThe IDS Progress Chart component is now a WebComponent. Instead of using classes to define it, it is done directly with a custom element and attributes:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x progress chart example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n  <div id=\"example-8c\" class=\"chart-container\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```js\n  $('body').on('initialized', function() {\n    var dataset8 = [{\n      data: [{\n        name: {text: 'Old Progress Chart'},\n        info: {value: '13h'},\n        completed: {value: 13, color: '#D66221'}\n      }]\n    }];\n\n    var api8c = $('#example-8c').chart({dataset: dataset8, type: 'completion-target'}).data('chart');\n  });\n```\n\n<!-- this is the same progress chart using the WebComponent -->\n```html\n<ids-progress-chart label=\"New Progress Chart\" progress=\"13\" label-progress=\"13h\" color=\"#D66221\"></ids-progress-chart>\n```\n"

two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt3\" label=\"Option three\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Disabled Group (each radio will set to disabled):\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" disabled=\"true\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Disabled Item:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\"

three\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n<button id=\"btn-radio-validate\">Validate</button>\n```\n\nYou can also check validation with the JS api.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector('#btn-radio-validate').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  const radio = document.querySelector('#ids-radio-validation');\n  radio.checkValidation();\n});\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Radio Group without label required indicator:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" label-required=\"false\" validate=\"required\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Horizontal:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" horizontal=\"true\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes) (for Radios)\n\n- `checked` {boolean} set checked state.\n- `color` {string} set the color for radio.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `group-disabled` {boolean} set disabled state, if group disabled.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} set radio layout inline as horizontal.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `validation-has-error` {boolean} set the validation error state.\n- `value` {string} set the radio value.\n\n## Settings (Attributes) (for Radio Groups)\n\n- `dirty-tracker` {boolean} set dirty tracker.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} set radio group layout inline as horizontal.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `label-required` {boolean} set validation `required` indicator, default is set to `true`.\n- `validate` {string} set the validation rule `required`.\n- `validation-events` {string} set the validation events, use `space` to add multiple default is set to `change`.\n- `value` {string} set the radio group value, will set as checked the matching radio value in list.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `radio` allows you to further style the actual radio input element\n- `circle` allows you to further style the visible circle element\n- `label` allows you to further style the label text element\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Unchecked\n- Checked/Selected\n- Hover\n- Disabled\n- Focus\n- Error\n- Dirty\n- Active\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Radio doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard radio input element:\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the edit field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggle the checked/unchecked state on the active radio button.\n- <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>, Moves within a radio group, each key will move and set checked next radio in the list.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default display set vertical but can also use the  `horizontal` attribute as true for some cases.\n- Default display set as `block`, but can change to `inline-block` by use of `horizontal` attribute as `true`.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Radio button styles were implemented in 4.0.0\n- Radio buttons were CSS-only components\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Radio component has changed to a custom element `<ids-radio-group></ids-radio-group>`\n- Individual radio buttons are standalone custom elements `<ids-radio></ids-radio>` and are slotted into groups\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n### Converting from 4.x\n\nRadio Buttons are now standalone web components instead of being defined only with CSS styles:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x radio example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt1\" id=\"option1\" />\n  <label for=\"option1\" class=\"radio-label\">Option one</label>\n</div>\n\n<!-- This is the same radio using a WebComponent -->\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nThe same rules apply to Radio Groups, which are also now standalone web components:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x radio group example -->\n<fieldset class=\"radio-group\">\n  <legend>Select delivery method</legend>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt1\" id=\"option1\" />\n  <label for=\"option1\" class=\"radio-label\">Option one</label>\n  <br/>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt2\" checked=\"true\"

IDS Radio Group will add sudo ui `*` for required elements.\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nA standard single unchecked radio element:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nSet the radio as checked:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nAdd an unchecked and disabled radio:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nAdd an checked and disabled radio:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" checked=\"true\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nAdd an colored radio - use this option only in special use cases\n\n```html\n<ids-radio checked=\"true\" color=\"emerald07\" value=\"emerald07\" label=\"Emerald 07\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nA standard Radio Group unchecked element:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet as Checked, the radio in Radio Group.\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as No label.\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group Checked and Value\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" value=\"opt1\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet the Dirty Tracking to Radio Group this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" dirty-tracker=\"true\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt3\" label=\"Option three\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Disabled Group (each radio will set to disabled):\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" disabled=\"true\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Disabled Item:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt3\" label=\"Option three\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Radio Group this way:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" validate=\"required\" id=\"ids-radio-validation\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt3\" label=\"Option three\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n<button id=\"btn-radio-validate\">Validate</button>\n```\n\nYou can also check validation with the JS api.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector('#btn-radio-validate').addEventListener('click', () => {\n  const radio = document.querySelector('#ids-radio-validation');\n  radio.checkValidation();\n});\n```\n\nSet validation `required` to Radio Group without label required indicator:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" label-required=\"false\" validate=\"required\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\nSet Radio Group as Horizontal:\n\n```html\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\" horizontal=\"true\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n\n## Settings (Attributes) (for Radios)\n\n- `checked` {boolean} set checked state.\n- `color` {string} set the color for radio.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `group-disabled` {boolean} set disabled state, if group disabled.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} set radio layout inline as horizontal.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `validation-has-error` {boolean} set the validation error state.\n- `value` {string} set the radio value.\n\n## Settings (Attributes) (for Radio Groups)\n\n- `dirty-tracker` {boolean} set dirty tracker.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `horizontal` {boolean} set radio group layout inline as horizontal.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `label-required` {boolean} set validation `required` indicator, default is set to `true`.\n- `validate` {string} set the validation rule `required`.\n- `validation-events` {string} set the validation events, use `space` to add multiple default is set to `change`.\n- `value` {string} set the radio group value, will set as checked the matching radio value in list.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `radio` allows you to further style the actual radio input element\n- `circle` allows you to further style the visible circle element\n- `label` allows you to further style the label text element\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Unchecked\n- Checked/Selected\n- Hover\n- Disabled\n- Focus\n- Error\n- Dirty\n- Active\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Radio doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard radio input element:\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the edit field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> Toggle the checked/unchecked state on the active radio button.\n- <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowRight</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>, <kbd>ArrowLeft</kbd>, Moves within a radio group, each key will move and set checked next radio in the list.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default display set vertical but can also use the  `horizontal` attribute as true for some cases.\n- Default display set as `block`, but can change to `inline-block` by use of `horizontal` attribute as `true`.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Radio button styles were implemented in 4.0.0\n- Radio buttons were CSS-only components\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Radio component has changed to a custom element `<ids-radio-group></ids-radio-group>`\n- Individual radio buttons are standalone custom elements `<ids-radio></ids-radio>` and are slotted into groups\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n### Converting from 4.x\n\nRadio Buttons are now standalone web components instead of being defined only with CSS styles:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x radio example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt1\" id=\"option1\" />\n  <label for=\"option1\" class=\"radio-label\">Option one</label>\n</div>\n\n<!-- This is the same radio using a WebComponent -->\n<ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n```\n\nThe same rules apply to Radio Groups, which are also now standalone web components:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x radio group example -->\n<fieldset class=\"radio-group\">\n  <legend>Select delivery method</legend>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt1\" id=\"option1\" />\n  <label for=\"option1\" class=\"radio-label\">Option one</label>\n  <br/>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt2\" checked=\"true\" id=\"option2\" />\n  <label for=\"option2\"  class=\"radio-label\">Option two</label>\n  <br/>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt3\" id=\"option3\" />\n  <label for=\"option3\" class=\"radio-label\">Option three</label>\n  <br/>\n  <input type=\"radio\" class=\"radio\" name=\"options\" value=\"opt4\" disabled=\"true\" id=\"option4\" />\n  <label for=\"option4\" class=\"radio-label\">Option four</label>\n</fieldset>\n\n<!-- this is the same radio group using the WebComponent -->\n<ids-radio-group label=\"Select delivery method\">\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt1\" label=\"Option one\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt2\" label=\"Option two\" checked=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt3\" label=\"Option three\"></ids-radio>\n  <ids-radio value=\"opt4\" label=\"Option four\" disabled=\"true\"></ids-radio>\n</ids-radio-group>\n```\n"

        "value": "# Ids Scroll View Component\n\n## Description\n\nThe scroll view component allows swipe and scroll in between a number of slides/tabs or pages. The user can click the circle buttons or swipe left or right to activate adjacent page/slide/tabs. This component is roughly similar to the previous \"Circle Pager\". Its also similar to a \"Carousel\".\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Use when a user is primarily a mobile user and they need to flip through a set of related objects or pages.\n- Do Not Use as a dumping ground for content or for primary / main interaction\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Circle Pager**: The older 4.x name for his component\n- **Carousel**: Another name for this sort of component with slides and buttons\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `loop` {boolean} sets the loop, true will loop back after next/previous reached to end\n- `show-tooltip` {boolean} sets the tooltip for circle buttons\n- `suppress-controls` {boolean} sets suppress controls for circle buttons\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `container` allows you to further style the parent container element\n- `scroll-view` allows you to further style the scrolling container\n- `controls` allows you to further style the control button area\n- `scroll-view-button` allows you to further style the individual circle buttons in the carousel\n\n## Events\n\n- `beforefirst` Fires before move to first slide, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `beforeprevious` Fires before move to previous slide, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `beforenext` Fires before move to next slide, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `beforelast` Fires before move to last slide, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `beforeslideto` Fires before move to given slide, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `scrolled` Fires after each slide move\n\n## Methods\n\n- `first(): void` Move to first slide\n- `previous(): void` Move to previous slide\n- `next(): void` Move to next slide\n- `last(): void` Move to last slide\n- `slideTo(slideNumber: number): void` Slide to given slide number\n- `currentSlideNumber(): number | undefined` Get the current slide number\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA scrollview with images. You just need to add each element to the scroll view. Each of the immediate children should get `slot=\"scroll-view-item\"`. If using images the `alt` tag is very important for accessibility. As a tip you can add \"Slide N\" or similar text to the alt tag as it helps screen reader users for context.\n\n```html\n<ids-scroll-view>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-1.png\" alt=\"Slide 1, Sony Camera, Front\"/>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-2.png\" alt=\"Slide 3, Sony Camera, Back Display\"/>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-3.png\" alt=\"Slide 3, Sony Camera, From Top\"/>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-4.png\" alt=\"Slide 4, Olympus Camera, Front\"/>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-5.png\" alt=\"Slide 5, Olympus Camera, Exposed to water\"/>\n    <img slot=\"scroll-view-item\" src=\"../assets/images/camera-6.png\" alt=\"Slide 6, Sony E-mount Camera, Front\"/>\n</ids-scroll-view>\n```\n\n## States and Variations\n\n- Focus\n- Active Slide\n- Scrolling\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: Tabs you into the sider control area\n- <kbd>ArrowLeft / ArrowRight</kbd>: Moves to the next or previous slide\n\n## Responsive\n\n- The container will respect the width and size of its parent flowing if necessary. If using images they may stretch so you may need to constrain the contain.\n\n## Mobile Guidelines\n\n- Swipe left or swipe right will do the same as clicking the next button in the list of buttons\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Circle Pager component replaced `.inforCarousel()` and `.circlePage()` from 3.x in a more limited fashion\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- IdsScrollView component replaces Circle Pager from the previous version and adds swiping\n- Markup has changed to a custom element `<ids-scroll-view></ids-scroll-view>`\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/yaJ8mJrqRRej8oTsd6iT8P/IDS-(SoHo)-Component-Library-v4.5?node-id=760%3A771)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- The first tab activated the list of tabs (the circle buttons)\n- Left and up key expose the previous or next slide\n- Only interactive elements on the visible slide can get focus\n- The tab container gets focus with the keyboard\n- The complementary landmark role is used to identify all the content and interactive controls associated with the carousel widget.\n- The landmark provides a means to navigate to and identify the carousel features.\n- `tablist` and `tab` roles are defined for the dots used to indicate the number of slides and which slide is selected.\n- `tabpanel` roles are defined for the slide content\n- `button` role is used to override semantics of the a element used to define the previous and next slide\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nInternal Labels will be localized in the current language. The scroll direction and active button will be enabled. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

When the skip link is focused from the browser URL using <kbd>Tab</kbd>, it will activate allowing you to jump to a main section. The main content is not usually the first thing on a web page. Keyboard and screen reader users generally must navigate a long list of navigation links, sub-lists of links, corporate icons, site searches, and other elements before ever arriving at the main content. This is particularly difficult for users with some forms of motor disabilities.\n\nFor more details info on skip links see <a href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a>.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you want to add accessibility features to your application\n- When you have a lot of content at the top of every page such as links/navigation/headers that may need to be jumped over when familiar with the page\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Link/Hyperlink**: An interactive link to another page within Infor software to external destinations.\n- **Skip Link**: An interactive link to jump past some page content\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA normal skip link element as a custom element.

Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLink text should be localized in the current language. And should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

The swaplist makes use of IdsSwappable for sorting and swapping functionality and IdsCard for layout.\n\n## Use Cases\n\nA common usecase for swaplists is to select items from a list of available objects. On one list, the user can view all available items. The user can then move an item from the available list to the selected list, and vice versa. This allows the user to view and track all items in the dataset. Users can drag and drop objects from list to list or select items and click an icon to move them to the desired list.\n\n## Features (With Code Samples)\n\nExample using js to populate the lists:\n\n```html\n<ids-swaplist id=\"swaplist-1\" count=\"2\"></ids-swaplist>\n```\n\n```js\nconst swappable = document.querySelector('#swaplist-1').container.querySelectorAll('ids-swappable');\n\ndata.forEach((d) => {\n    swappable.innerHTML += `\n    <ids-swappable-item>\n        <ids-text>${d.city}</ids-text>\n    </ids-swappable-item>\n    `;\n});\n```\n## Settings (Attributes)\n**count** Sets the amount of lists on the page.

See [Ids Dirty Tracker Mixin](../../mixins/ids-dirty-tracker-mixin/README.md) for more information.\n- `disabled` {boolean} set disabled state.\n- `label` {string} set the label text.\n- `labelRequired` {boolean} set the required indicator on label text.\n- `maxlength` {number|string} set the maximum characters allowed in textarea.\n- `placeholder` {string} set the placeholder text to textarea.\n- `printable` {boolean} set whether or not the textarea can be displayed on a printed page.\n- `size` {string} set the textarea size, it will set `md` as defaults.\n- `readonly` {boolean} set readonly state.\n- `resizable` {boolean} set to resize the height of the textarea.\n- `rows` {number|string} set to visible height of a textarea in lines.\n- `text-align` {string} set text-align to textarea, it will set `left` as defaults.\n- `type` {string} set the textarea type, it will set `text` as defaults.\n- `validate` {string} set the textarea validation rules, use `space` to add multiple validation rules.\n- `validationEvents` {string} set the textarea validation events, use `space` to add multiple validation rules, it will set `blur` as defaults.\n- `value` {string} set the textarea value.\n\n## Themeable Parts\n\n- `textarea` allows you to further style the textarea input element\n- `label` allows you to further style the label text\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\nThe IDS Textarea doesn't contain any interactions beyond a standard HTMLTextareaElement:\n\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift Tab</kbd> moves focus into the edit field to/from the next focusable item in the tab order.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Default size is 362px wide but there are a number of widths.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Textarea was implemented in v4.0.0\n- Textarea can be invoked with `$('#my-element').textarea()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Textareas are now custom elements `<ids-textarea></ids-textarea>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n- If using the `clearable` attribute, the \"X\" trigger button on the textarea is now tabbable by default for accessibility\n\n### Converting from 4.x\n\nThe IDS Textarea component is now a WebComponent. Instead of using classes to define the type, it is done directly:\n\n```html\n<!-- 4.x textarea example -->\n<div class=\"field\">\n    <label for=\"textarea-desc\">Description</label>\n    <textarea class=\"textarea\" id=\"textarea-desc\" name=\"textarea-desc\"></textarea>\n</div>\n\n<!-- this is the same textarea using the WebComponent -->\n<ids-textarea label=\"Description\" id=\"textarea-desc\"></ids-textarea>\n```\n\n## Designs\n\n## Alternate Designs\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Accessibility - Axe\n1. Visual Regression Test\n1. Repeat Tests in All Supported Browsers\n1. Some of these as test cases from the [WC gold standard](https://github.com/webcomponents/gold-standard/wiki#api)\n1. Can be consumed in NG/Vue/React (pull it in standalone/built see it works standalone)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n## Regional Considerations\n"

        "value": "# Ids Theme Switcher Component\n\n## Description\n\nWe include a theme switcher component that can be visual or non visual. If visual it comes with a menu button to allow you to pick theme. If non visible you can set its properties and all other components in the page will change theme to the set theme.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- When you want to use a common look across applications with a theme\n- When you prefer a dark vs light mode or need a high contrast mode for low light situations or Accessibility.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Theme**: A broad term to describe changing the look of the application. We essentially have 6 themes from a historical sense but have tried change Terminology over time and currently refer to a theme as one of the UI versions (New vs Classic)\n- **Modes**: Formerly called Variant and lets you switch between dark, light and high contrast with in the version essentially constituting a new theme.\n- **Versions**: Formerly called Theme and lets you switch between the New look and the Classic look and maybe in the future more themes.\n- **New**: The new Formerly called Uplift and Vibrant\n- **Classic**: Formerly called Soho and Subtle\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nAdd an ids-theme-switcher to the page near the top and set the version and mode properties.\n\n```html\n<ids-theme-switcher mode=\"dark\"></ids-theme-switcher>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `version` {string} Turns on the functionality to make the tag clickable like a link\n- `mode` {string} Turns on the functionality to add an (x) button to clear remove the tag\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions\n\n- 3.x: This version did not have any themes\n- 4.x: You no longer change the style sheet out like in previous versions\n- 5.x: You no longer need to change the style sheet out like in previous versions because the css in encapsulated within each component now\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n- Fix Accessibility issue (1.4.1 Use of Color) by adding an icon to the color tags.\n- Fix Accessibility issue (1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)) by changing or not using some tags\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. The New Version of the theme has better color usage than the classic theme.\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   The New Version of the theme has better contrast than the classic theme. Light and Dark mode pass WCAG AA and High Contrast passes WCAG AAA\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nAs a point of interest colors can have certain meanings associated with them for countries and cultures. We found this [article on color meaning](https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/color-symbolism-and-meanings-around-the-world) interesting.\n"

still read out loud by screen readers\n- `destroyOnComplete` {boolean} Set to destroy after complete all the toast messages\n- `draggable` {boolean} Set user to allows drag/drop the toast container\n- `position` {string} Set position of the toast container in specific place\n- `progressBar` {boolean} Set toast to have a visible progress bar\n- `savePosition` {boolean} Set toast container to save position to local storage, apply only when draggable set to true\n- `timeout` {number} Set the amount of time, the toast should be present on-screen\n- `uniqueId` {number} Set uniqueId to save to local storage, so same saved position can be use for whole app, apply only when draggable set to true\n\n## Settings and Attributes (Toast Message)\n\n- `audible` {boolean} Set as invisible on the screen, but still read out loud by screen readers\n- `progressBar` {boolean} Set toast to have a visible progress bar\n- `timeout` {number} Set the amount of time, the toast should be present on-screen\n- `messageId` {string} Set id to manage each toast message\n\n## Theme-able Parts (Toast Message)\n\n- `toast` allows you to further style the toast element\n- `title` allows you to further style the toast title element\n- `message` allows you to further style the toast message element\n- `progress-bar` allows you to further style the toast progress bar element\n- `close-button` allows you to further style the toast close button element\n- `close-button-icon` allows you to further style the toast close button icon element\n\n## Events (Toast)\n\n- `add-message` Fires while the toast message is added to container\n- `remove-message` Fires while the toast message is removed from container\n- `save-position` Fires after the local storage settings changed in some way\n- `clear-position` Fires after clear the saved position from local storage\n- `remove-container` Fires after removed the toast message container\n\n## Events (Toast Message)\n\n- `remove-message` Fires while the toast message is removed from container\n\n## Methods (Toast)\n\n- `clearPosition(uniqueId: string|undefined)` Clear the saved position from local storage, If uniqueId is undefined will use Internal attached\n- `clearPositionAll()` Clear all toast related saved position from local storage\n- `messageElem(messageId: string)` Get message element by given message id\n- `show(options: IdsToastShowSettings)` Set to show the toast message\n- `toastContainer()` Get the toast container\n\n## Methods (Toast Message)\n\n- `removeToastMessage()` Remove the toast message from container\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Audible\n- Auto Closeable\n- Closeable\n- Contains Link\n- Draggable\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift+Tab</kbd>: If the tab is focusable this will focus or unfocus the toast.\n- <kbd>Control+Alt+P</kbd>: It will toggle pause and play timeout timer.\n- <kbd>Escape</kbd>: It will close the toast message.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Toasts can be configured to appear at either the top-start, top-end, bottom-start or bottom-end of an application window.\n- Will be placed in the top-end corner by default.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Toasts were implemented in v4.0.0\n- Toasts can be invoked with `$('#my-element').toast()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Toasts are now custom elements `<ids-toast></ids-toast>`\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/ok0LLOT9PP1J0kBkPMaZ5c/IDS_Component_File_v4.6-(Draft))\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLabels should be localized in the current language. The close icon and progress bar will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).\n"

The tree consists of categories, subcategories and is vertical in format.\nTrees present a hierarchically structured list. Each node in the hierarchy may have child nodes, and nodes that have children may be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the children.\n\nFor example, in a file system that uses tree to display folders and files, a node representing a folder can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder, which may be files, folders, or both. Tree node depth visualized by indentation in a list.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Tree component use to display hierarchically structured list.\n- To select node out of a set of hierarchically structured list

(Tree)\n\n- `tree` allows you to further style the tree element\n\n## Theme-able Parts (Tree Node)\n\n- `group-node` allows you to further style the group node element\n- `node` allows you to further style the node element\n- `node-container` allows you to further style the node container element\n- `icon` allows you to further style the icon element\n- `toggle-icon` allows you to further style the toggle icon element\n- `text` allows you to further style the text element\n\n## Events (Tree)\n\n- `beforeselected` Fires before the tree node/group get selected, you can return false in the

container\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Badges: Ability to show some extra content\n- Custom Icons: End user can set custom icons to each node\n- Data/Datasource: Tree use the data array to set nodes\n- Disabled: Disabled nodes cannot be clicked, hovered, focused or selected\n- Expand or Collapse: Tree can display show/hide child nodes thru its parent/group node\n- Selection (single): Tree supports the single node selection\n- Toggle Target: This provide to toggle expand/collapse by icon only\n- Tree by Markup: Tree can set thru the markup only\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift + Tab</kbd>: This will focus or unfocus the tree.\n- <kbd>Enter or Space</kbd>: Performs the default action (select and toggle node) as on click event for the focused node.\n- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the next node that is focusable without opening or closing a node. If focus is on the last node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the previous node that is focusable without opening or closing a node. If focus is on the first node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>: When focus is on a closed node, it opens the node and focus does not move. When focus is on a open node, it moves focus to the first child node. When focus is on an end node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: When focus is on an open node, it closes the node. When focus is on a child node that is also either node or a closed group node, it moves focus to its parent node. When focus is on a root node that is also either node or a closed group node, it does nothing.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container.\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/ri2Knf3KchdfdzRAeds0Ab/IDS-Mobility-v4.6?node-id=1%3A5740)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- Tree component contained in the element has a `role=\"tree\"` and `aria-label`\n- Each node element contains with `role=\"treeitem\"`\n- Each node element contains its current state with a `boolean` value as `aria-disabled`, `aria-selected`  and if it's a parent/group node `aria-expanded`\n- Each node element contains its current position with a `number` value as `aria-level`, `aria-setsize`, `aria-posinset`\n- Each parent/group node element contains with `role=\"group\"`\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nIn Right To Left Languages the icons, text and alignment will flow to the other side. Labels should be localized in the current language.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Tree was introduced in v4.2.0\n- Tree is comprised of new HTML markup and classes, and is invoked with `$('#my-element').tree()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Tree is now a custom element. `<ids-tree></ids-tree>`\n- Individual Tree nodes are now also custom elements. `<ids-tree-node></ids-tree-node>`\n- Tree nodes can contain other tree nodes (nesting).\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n"

(Tree)\n\n- `tree` allows you to further style the tree element\n\n## Theme-able Parts (Tree Node)\n\n- `group-node` allows you to further style the group node element\n- `node` allows you to further style the node element\n- `node-container` allows you to further style the node container element\n- `icon` allows you to further style the icon element\n- `toggle-icon` allows you to further style the toggle icon element\n- `text` allows you to further style the text element\n\n## Events (Tree)\n\n- `beforeselected` Fires before the tree node/group get selected, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `selected` Fires after the tree node/group get selected\n- `beforeunselected` Fires before the tree node/group get unselected, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `unselected` Fires after the tree node/group get unselected\n- `beforecollapsed` Fires before the tree group get collapsed, you can return false in the response to veto.\n- `collapsed` Fires after the tree group get collapsed\n- `beforeexpanded` Fires before the tree group get expanded, you can return false in the response to veto\n- `expanded` Fires after the tree group get expanded\n\n## Methods (Tree)\n\n- `collapseAll(): void` Collapse all attached nodes to the tree\n- `expandAll(): void` Expand all attached nodes to the tree\n- `collapse(selector: string): void` Collapse a tree node by given CSS selector\n- `expand(selector: string): void` Expand a tree node by given CSS selector\n- `toggle(selector: string): void` Toggle a tree node by given CSS selector\n- `select(selector: string): void` Selects a tree node by given CSS selector\n- `unselect(selector: string): void` UnSelects a tree node by given CSS selector\n- `isSelected(selector: string): boolean` Check if related node is selected or not, by given CSS selector\n- `getNode(selector: string): object` Get a tree node by given CSS selector\n\n## Methods (Tree Node)\n\n- `setFocus(): void` Set focus to node container\n\n## States and Variations (With Code Examples)\n\n- Badges: Ability to show some extra content\n- Custom Icons: End user can set custom icons to each node\n- Data/Datasource: Tree use the data array to set nodes\n- Disabled: Disabled nodes cannot be clicked, hovered, focused or selected\n- Expand or Collapse: Tree can display show/hide child nodes thru its parent/group node\n- Selection (single): Tree supports the single node selection\n- Toggle Target: This provide to toggle expand/collapse by icon only\n- Tree by Markup: Tree can set thru the markup only\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- <kbd>Tab/Shift + Tab</kbd>: This will focus or unfocus the tree.\n- <kbd>Enter or Space</kbd>: Performs the default action (select and toggle node) as on click event for the focused node.\n- <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the next node that is focusable without opening or closing a node. If focus is on the last node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Up Arrow</kbd>: Moves focus to the previous node that is focusable without opening or closing a node. If focus is on the first node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>: When focus is on a closed node, it opens the node and focus does not move. When focus is on a open node, it moves focus to the first child node. When focus is on an end node, it does nothing.\n- <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>: When focus is on an open node, it closes the node. When focus is on a child node that is also either node or a closed group node, it moves focus to its parent node. When focus is on a root node that is also either node or a closed group node, it does nothing.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- Flows with padding and margin within the width and height of the parent container.\n\n## Designs\n\n[Design Specs](https://www.figma.com/file/ri2Knf3KchdfdzRAeds0Ab/IDS-Mobility-v4.6?node-id=1%3A5740)\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- Tree component contained in the element has a `role=\"tree\"` and `aria-label`\n- Each node element contains with `role=\"treeitem\"`\n- Each node element contains its current state with a `boolean` value as `aria-disabled`, `aria-selected`  and if it's a parent/group node `aria-expanded`\n- Each node element contains its current position with a `number` value as `aria-level`, `aria-setsize`, `aria-posinset`\n- Each parent/group node element contains with `role=\"group\"`\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nIn Right To Left Languages the icons, text and alignment will flow to the other side. Labels should be localized in the current language.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Tree was introduced in v4.2.0\n- Tree is comprised of new HTML markup and classes, and is invoked with `$('#my-element').tree()`.\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Tree is now a custom element. `<ids-tree></ids-tree>`\n- Individual Tree nodes are now also custom elements. `<ids-tree-node></ids-tree-node>`\n- Tree nodes can contain other tree nodes (nesting).\n- If using events, events are now plain JS events.\n- Can now be imported as a single JS file and used with encapsulated styles.\n"

        "value": "# Ids Treemap Component\n\n## Description\n\nTreemaps are used to display hierarchical data. This is useful when space is constrained and you need to see an overview of a large amount of hierarchical data. Treemaps should primarily be used with values that can be aggregated. Treemaps are economical in that they can be used within a limited space and yet display a large number of items simultaneously. When there is a correlation between color and size in the tree structure, you are able to see patterns that would be difficult to spot in other ways, for example, when a certain color is particularly relevant.\n\nTreemaps are not good when there is a big difference in the magnitude of the measure values. Nor is a treemap the right choice when mixing absolute and relative values. Negative values cannot be displayed in treemaps.\n\n## Terminology\n**result** This is a property / attr where the treemap data object gets stored.\n**title** This is an attribute where the treemap title is stored.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\n```html\n    <ids-treemap title=\"Storage Utilization (78 GB)\"></ids-treemap>\n```\n\n```js\nconst treeMapEl = document.querySelector('ids-treemap');\n\n  treeMapEl.result = treeMapEl.treeMap({\n    data: [\n      {\n        value: 28,\n        color: '#003876',\n        text: 'JSON',\n        label: '28%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 18,\n        color: '#004A99',\n        text: 'PDF',\n        label: '18%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 8,\n        color: '#0054B1',\n        text: 'BOD',\n        label: '8%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 8,\n        color: '#0066D4',\n        text: 'TXT',\n        label: '8%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 17,\n        color: '#0072ED',\n        text: 'CSV',\n        label: '17%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 7,\n        color: '#1C86EF',\n        text: 'Assets',\n        label: '7%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 14,\n        color: '#55A3F3',\n        text: 'Others',\n        label: '14%'\n      },\n    ],\n    width: 1000, // Optional. By default takes the width of the container.\n    height: 300\n  });\n```\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\nThe contrast and actual colors can be a concern for visibility impaired and color blind people. However, you can customize the color by passing different contrast colors in the color option.\n\n## Usage Guidance\n\n- **data** Required. The data format should be as follows:\n```js\n{\n    data: [{\n        value: 28,\n        color: '#003876',\n        text: 'JSON',\n        label: '28%'\n      },\n      {\n        value: 18,\n        color: '#004A99',\n        text: 'PDF',\n        label: '18%'\n      }\n    ],\n    height: 300\n}\n```\n\n- **width** By default the treemap takes on the width of the container. The treemap will resize as the screen size changes.\n= **height** Required. You will need to set the height for the treemap.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nThis chart has no keyboard functionality\n\n## Responsive Information\n\nAs you resize the chart will redraw with in the width of the container width. The nodes in the treemap are sized in proportion.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Treemap was a new component created in v4.6.0\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Treemap is now a custom element `<ids-treemap></ids-treemap>`\n"

A user can view a depiction of their current status within a process, and may optionally navigate between points. Best for displaying progress relative to the start and finish of a user workflow.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- displaying a list of steps that have to be fulfilled in a given/pre-determined order.\n- optionally allowing a user to traverse a set of, or part of a set of steps.\n\n## Terminology\n\n- **Wizard**: the overall flow/process\n- **Step**: an individual step in the IdsWizard component; represented here by `IdsWizardStep`/`<ids-wizard-step>`\n\n## Themeable Parts\n- `wizard` allows you to style the overall wizard.\n- `step` allows you to style the step (markers + labels).\n- `path-segment` allows you to further style the line segments between markers.\n\n## Features (With Code Examples)\n\nA wizard is created by using the custom `ids-wizard` element. It's sub-components/steps are represented by `<ids-wizard-step>`.\n\nContent within the `<ids-wizard-step>` instances will be the text displayed in the label at each of these steps.\n\nThe current step number a wizard is showing has been traversed is denoted now only with the `step-number` attribute on `ids-wizard`.\n\n```html\n<ids-wizard step-number=1>\n  <ids-wizard-step>Step One<ids-wizard-step>\n  <ids-wizard-step> Step Two</ids-wizard-step>\n</ids-wizard>\n```\n\n## Settings and Attributes\n\n- `clickable` `{boolean}` If set, a user can click each step. Note that this is also settable within the `ids-wizard-step` children components to only enable specific step(s) to be clickable.\n- `step-number` the current step number.\n\n## Keyboard Guidelines\n\n- TAB should move to next step and/or label.\n- SHIFT + TAB should move to previous step and/or label.\n- ENTER key should select the focused label/step as well as change the page URL hash.\n\n## Responsive Guidelines\n\n- The wizard component's width should not exceed the width of the page.\n- The labels chosen and number of steps should fit within the page; or at least be obvious enough that a user can discern what labels achieve what function.\n\n## Designs\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n\n- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - there should be enough contrast on the background which the wizard resides on in the page.\n\n## Regional Considerations\n\nLabel text should be localized in the current language. All elements will flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai). For some of these cases text-ellipsis is supported.\n\n## Converting from Previous Versions (Breaking Changes)\n\n**3.x to 4.x**\n\n- Wizard was a new component created in v4.0.0\n\n**4.x to 5.x**\n\n- Wizard is now a custom element `<ids-wizard></ids-wizard>`\n- \"Ticks\" are now called \"Steps\", and are codified as custom elements `<ids-wizard-step>MY-LABEL</ids-wizard-step>`\n- Setting the step number is done via `ids-wizard`'s `step-number` attribute.\n- `clickable` property is available on both any `ids-wizard-step` and `ids-wizard` overall.\n"
