## Installation

The components are available via npm/yarn:

```sh
npm install --save ids-enterprise-wc@latest
```

To Clone and Run this Repo locally (requires node 18 (16 or 17))

```sh
mkdir enterprise-wc
cd enterprise-wc
git clone git@github.com:infor-design/enterprise-wc.git .
npm i
npm run start
```

Also include the [Source Sans Pro Font](https://github.com/infor-design/ids-foundation/blob/main/fonts/README.md) in your project and app pages.

## Using Code Hinting

The npm package ships with a file called `vscode.html-custom-data.json`. The file describes the custom elements and their settings for use in Visual Studio Code to provide “IntelliSense”. To enable it, you just need to tell VS Code where the file is.

1. As per above, install with `npm install --save ids-enterprise-wc@latest`
1. Create a folder called `.vscode` at the root of your project
1. Create a file inside that folder called `settings.json`
1. Add the following setting to the file.

```json
{
  "html.customData": ["./node_modules/ids-enterprise-wc/vscode.html-custom-data.json"]
}
```

You may need to restart VS Code for the changes to take affect.

Most popular editors support custom code completion with different configurations. Please [submit a feature request and/or pull request](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/issues/new/choose) if you want to add your editor.
